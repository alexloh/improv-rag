Our goal is to improve these repsonses using RAG by ingesting information scrapped from [Improv Encyclopedia](https://improvencyclopedia.org/games/index.html).

## ChatGPT call
Follow example from Don Woodlocks' [How to set up RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8tOjiYEFqU)
