 Description 

A great exercise to train scene start-ups. 2 players initiate a scene; the scene is broken off after 3 lines.  The goal is to establish as much as possible as fast as possible.  We want to understand the  Platform, the  Characters , the  Environment and the points of view or drivers of the characters.

"This improv game is called 3 Series and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Concentration
 Exercise
 Look and Listen


 Description 

Everyone in a circle.  Pick a category (e.g. make of cars, girls names, 
kinds of food, kinds of plants, whatever).  First person states an example of the category, and points to someone else.  Keep pointing.  That someone else does the same, with a different item in the category, and so forth, until everyone 
points at one person.

 Then repeat the pattern.  Make eye contact when passing your item to the
next person.  Drop the pointing arms when everyone is comfortable and the series
is collectively memorized.

 Then do the same with a second category, and make sure the pointing pattern
is different.  Repeat till everyone is comfortable.

 Then do the same exercise, without pointing, and running the 2 categories 
at the same time.  Add a third, fourth category if you wish.  No pointing arms any more!

 The idea is not only to listen for the item right before yours in the series (so you know when it`s 
your turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you.  If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken.  See also  You.

 Variations 
 Add another pattern by taking the next person's place in the circle."

 Exercise


 Description 

Simple exercise, useful for players that are too verbal.

 One player starts a scene.  As soon as the trainer claps his hands, the player needs to make whatever he was doing more interesting, without
advancing.  If our player was opening a briefcase at the clap, he needs to make `opening a briefcase` more interesting; he is not allowed to 
take something out of the briefcase, as that would be advancing; player needs to stick to `opening the briefcase`.

 Notes 

Simple to explain but not so easy to play. When done well you move into the clownesque.  Think about Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy or Mr. Bean.

 Variations 

At a second clap, allow the player to advance the scene.  Also known as Advancing and Expanding."

 Description 

One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a 
couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor).  The 
idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through
the room, by talking.  



Also known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name 
`Airplane`: The blindfoldee (or just eyes
closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors.
He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic
Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a
chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane
also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) to
reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed
two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a
direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may
step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly
forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be
given from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling
directors. You can also destroy all the trust you`ve built up in your
class by completely clearing 
the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us,
someone will suggest it.

 Description 

Excellent warm-up.  Everyone in a circle.  We are going to establish a rhythm,
by saying, all together `Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves`.  Keep repeating this.



One person starts making a gesture to this 
rhythm, say, tapping your head with 
you left hand.  When the sentence is repeated, the player next to her takes over
this gesture, while the first one starts a completely different new gesture.  Third time
the sentence is done, player three does the first gesture, player two does the 
second gesture and player one invents a new one again.  And so on.

 This is also a concentration game, though it`s not really difficult.  All 
one has to do is watch the previous player, and next time, take over her gesture.
When you`re watching what everyone else is doing you`re going to get lost though."

Fun game to warm up and to teach players some  Chivalry .  

Everyone in a circle.  There are 3 things a player can be:

 An alien: hold you index fingers up next to your head, as little antenna`s and say 
`Bleeb bleeb`, bending inwards into the circle;
 A cow: bend forward, hold your right 
hand on your tummy and go `Moooo`
 A tiger: push your right hand forward, imitating a claw and roar.

 On your sign, every player decides to become one of the three.  The idea is 
for everyone to become the same, which obviously won`t be the case, the first time.  We re-do this until everyone is in sync.

"This improv game is called Alliances and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Exercise
 Group


 Description 

4 players play a scene, in which one of the players gets excluded.  

 Notes 

This is a group exercise, in the sense that players should be sensing where the majority of the group is going (see  Alien Tiger Cow ).

Tell players not to be afraid of `being nasty` - be extreme in your exclusion (that makes it easier, also for the
player that is excluded - see  Mr. Nice Guy ).  Whoever gets excluded should 
gladly accept this and react accordingly.

Excluded players can go to extremes to be re-included - hilariously funny if even this is thoroughly ignored by the others.

 Variations 

Let the exclusion evolve; allow a player that got excluded to get 2 others to join him and exclude the fourth one.  
This only works if the excluded player first allows herself to be excluded (a little  Chivalry here).

 Also known as Alliances. . This game was originally created as a pattern game for 
long form shows at the Theatresports London Impro Lab in the late 1980`s.  
The whole point of the game is NOT to actively try and exclude anyone.  
The exclusion of one player should happen as a result of the other players 
making alliances with one another.  If you don`t do this the scene doesn`t form
 very good patterns and the players get too competitive.   
You also miss the slow, sliding status drops and the desperate attempts to 
hook into an existing alliance, that happen when a player is starting to 
nrealize that they are being excluded.

A good way to start this game would be:

 Start in a black-out seated round a table

 While the lights are still down the entire ensemble starts to laugh (as if someone has just told the punchline to a hilarious joke)

 The lights slowly fade up as the cast`s laughter winds down and the alliances begin to form

 By the end of the scene, which climaxes in a final, dramatic exclusion, we 
usually end up with four to six threads and a clear protagonist

the previous player`s name, attribute and 
gesture, and does something similar about himself.

 Description 

This is a scene consisting of 26 lines of dialog.  The first line starts with a 
given letter (say `R`).  The reply to that line must start with a `S`, and so
on, until the whole alphabet has been covered.  After `Z` comes `A`.

  Players that hesitate, or use the wrong letter `Die`, and are replaced by
another player.  The replacement needs to take over the character of the player
she replaces.

n Notes 

Urge players not to `stick` to the game - if you can`t think of a good
sentence to advance the story, it`s better to just `die` than to screw up the

 Performance


 Description 

Often an improv show starts with an audience warm-up.  Here are some
suggestions:

 Do a Mexican wave (audience making fluent waves with their hands above their head).
 Have he pianist/keyboard man make all kinds of sounds and have the audience imitate them
 Ask the audience to stand up and do some physical warm-up. Have them shake their arms and legs.
 Have the audience introduce themselves to strangers, tell a secret their spouse/partner doesn`t know about to a stranger, have them hug a stranger, tell your neighbor waht you ate today, your pin code
 Do an interview with the audience, where the MC is one character (say, a headmaster) and all of the audience 
another (say a naughty child). The audience needs to reply to the interview in one voice (all saying the same at the same time
 - see  One Mouth 
). Not an easy one, and if the audience does not feel like doing this it really sucks. When it works it`s a real thrill.
 divide the audience in 3 or 4 groups, and give each group a sound. Rehearse the sound with each group. Then tell a silly story, and use these sounds as sound effects. (We saw a pretty gruesome one in which one group was a car (roar), another a dog (bark) and the third group got a kind of splashing sound. The poor dog got run over by the car... not exactly nice but the audience had fun with it)
 Do a cheering competition between the men and the women.
 Rehearse different kinds of applause (from the `polite` applause when a 
scene sucks, over an `ooh` applause for a touching scene, to a wild roar 
for a hilarious scene). Have them rehearse voting for a team by cheering 
the team name (if that`s your format). 
Rehearse a `Die` ( see  Die ) if i
you`re going to be playing scenes in which the audience can decide to throw 
a player out of the game.
 Give the men and the women a different sound and play with that.  Tell them
they are members of a wild tribe, the women go `Ugh` when you raise your left
hand and the man go `Hagawaga` when you raise your right hand."

 Exercise
 Narration


 Description 
This is an exercise you can only do once with a group.  Use the exercise to
show that making stories is not all that difficult.

Split the group in 2.  Half of the players leave the room while you explain
the game to the others: we are going to make stories in pairs.  We will tell
the other players that we came up with a great story, and they have to guess
it.  The catch is that they can only ask yes/no questions, and we do not really
have a story.  We will answer `no` to every question that starts with a vowel
or with a 
conjugation of `to be` (or some other criterion).  In addition, after
having answered 2 consecutive No`s we will always answer a yes.

Let the other players back in and pair them up with the others.  Each couple 
starts guessing the story, unknowingly creating a story as they go.  Continue
till they get it.

 Trust


 Description 
This is can be used as a  Trust exercise, as well as in performance.

 2 players perform a slow dance together; each with their head on the other`s shoulder.  Hence they are not looking at each other.  While dancing they perform a 2-3 minute scene.

 This gives for 
great listening practice, since players aren`t looking at their partners.  If is also good for overcoming (physical) awkwardness between partners that are not familiar.  And it is a great exercise 
for physical work
in the dance, as in physical expression of the character`s feelings.

 Variations 

Drop the dance, and have players do a scene sitting back-to-back.  In the scene the characters need not be static; they may be walking, running, performinc any activity; it's just the players who are sitting down.  Also known as Also known as Back to Back.."

 Warm-up


 Description 

Silly warm-up to get the blood flowing.  A players in a circle, one player in 
the middle.   The player 
in the middle closes his eyes, holds right hand pointing 
in front of him, and spins around.  When done spinning, open your eyes and say, as fast as you can `Bippety Bippety Bop`.


The player you`re pointing to, and his 2 neighbors, need to build an elephant
in less than the time the middle player needs to say `Bippety Bippety Bop`.  
An elephant consists of a trunk, made by the middle player, by holding your nose with one hand, and extending your other arm through the arm that holds the hand that holds the nose (does this make any sense?).  
The neighboring players each 
form a big ear, using both arms.  Don`t forget to attach the ears to the 
elephant`s head.

 Any player that cannot get his/her part done by the time the middle player
does `Bippety Bippety Bop` becomes `it` and takes place in the middle of the 
circle.

 Variations 
You can really invent any object or create to replace the elephant. 
Try

 a car, with 2 wheels and a set of wind screen wipers
 a cow, 
with an udder and 2 horns
 a washing machine, with 2 players building a `box` with both arms, and the 
middle player waving her arms in a circle in front of her.  All go `rumble rumble`

 Format




The (slightly negative sounding) name is attributed to  Keith Johnstone 
and refers to shows consisting of short games, played in small rooms, like 
bars and tiny comedy clubs. 

In this simple format, a limited number of players (4-6) play improv games, 
introduced, and usually directed by an MC. In certain troupes the players 
take turns MC-ing and/or directing.

There are usually no judges, no score boards and no prizes to be won. 
Suggestions are taken from the audience, drawn out of a hat or provided by 
the MC. 

Due to the lack of space, there are usually no props or attributes, except 
for perhaps a coat hanger with clothes and a couple of hats; players 
typically mime their props.

As far as we know the name BarPro is not 
copyrighted."

 Narration
 Performance


 Description 

In this improv game, players tell a story out of order, once sentence at a time. 

 One player steps forward and makes up the first line of the story.  This player takes place to the utmost left of the scene. A second player steps forward and makes up a last line that has absolutely nothing to do with the first. Take utmost right of the scene.

The rest of the players each fill in a line of the story wherever they can, trying to bring things together and end up with a story that makes complete sense. Every time a new line is added, the players go down the string and repeat their lines first to last. This game works best with 7 or 8 players. 

 Players ideally fill up spots in the 'line' randomly, i.e. they contribute new sentences at random points in the story.

 As a suggestion you can either ask for a title, a genre, or even first line and last line.  Or ask for no suggestion at all.

 If you have say over 6 players, it is ideal that the 3rd line that is added it tack in the middle, and very unrelated to both first and last line.   Resist the temptation to fill the spots linearly (from left to right).

different ideas on how to do this.

 Ask the 
players to become

 A jar of mayonnaise

 At first, this will probably not lead to much.  Add side coachings, like:

 You are a jar of mayonnaise.  Opened or not?  Full or empty?  Fresh or not?  Show it.
 You are a pack of smokes.  Empty or full?  Filter cigarettes or not?  Where are you?  In someone`s pocket or
on a shelve in a shop?  Show it.
 You are a flower.  What kind of flower?  Blooming or not?   In a vase or in a field?  What color?  Freshly picked or not?  A present to a lover or at a funeral?
 You are water.  Still or not?  In a glass?  A jar, a puddle, a lake or an ocean?  Fresh or dirty?
 You are stone, air, sand, fire.
 Your are blue, red, green.  You are a clock.  Big Ben or grandfather clock?  Working or not.  Is your time right or not?  A watch?  Who is wearing you?  A nun or a pimp?  How could you show that?
 You are French fries.  McDonalds or Wendy`s?  Hot or cold?  Any ketchup?  On a 
plate or in a cardboard box?  Eaten or not?  Yummy or yuck?

"This improv game is called Behind closed doors and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Characters
 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 

The  Backstory for this  Long Form handle is as follows:

 We have an Evil Character.  The audience gets to choose who plays this character.
 The Evil Character will instruct 3-5 other characters to be at a specific (abandonded) place at a specific time.  There is no reason provided.  Audience get to choose which players play the 'invited' characters (the guests).
 Audience also gets to choose the location.  Good example is e.g. an abandoned factory on an island.  Location that have many rooms are ideal.

 The performance consists of 2 parts.  First part is 3-5 scenes in which each character is introduced.  In the scene, the Evil Character invites the guest.  There should be good reasons why the guests accept the invitation, based on whatever information was provided in the scene prior to the arrival of the Evil Character.

 Second part is where all guests have the rendez-vous in the chosen location.  They do not know each other; there is probably confusion.  When all guests have arrived, the Evil Character explains that be the end of the night, all guests but one will die.

 The guests then try and figure out why they are there, and perhaps evade their deaths.

 Supporting actors may play other characters the live ot, or haunt the location.

 It should be important that the characters cannot (easily) leave the location.  ( Also known as Behind closed doors. ).

 Performance ends either when only one guest remains alive and is set free by the Evil Character, or when the guests find out why they are there and are 'forgiven' by the Evil Character.  Or, alternatively, they might kill/capture the Evil Character and escape.

 Notes 

The Evil Character may turn out not to be the puppet master.  Perhaps he is just the messenger for an Even More Evil Character who reveals himself in the second part."

Big Booty, Big Booty, Big Booty (followed by a rest) - repeat this until 
everyone got the rhythm.

The game then goes as follows: Big Booty passes the buck to someone else, 
saying Big Booty to 7 (say) (this takes 2 beats, one for saying `Big Booty` and 
one for saying `to 7`).  Number 7 then passes in 2 beats to, say number 2, 
saying `7 to 2`.  It then continues  until someone makes a mistake: if and when that
happens everyone says (in 2 beats) `Oh Shit`, after which we repeat Big Booty
 Big Booty Big Booty (
+ rest on 4th beat), twice.  After that, the player that
made the mistake becomes Big Booty, and everyone`s number changes.  New Big
 Booty starts the game again."

before she can say `bop`, she becomes `it`.

Other possibilities are:

 Just say `bop` if anyone else reacts, that person becomes `it`
 Say `Elephant`, after which 3 players build the elephant: the 
player 
picked does the trunk (hold nose and squeeze your other arm through) and her 
neighbors do the ears.  If any of the 3 players screws up or does not react 
he or she becomes it.
 Say `mixer`: the player in the middle becomes a mixer, holding arms 
up in the air, sort of horizontally, while her neighbors position themselves
under her hands, and turn around their axises
 Say `toaster` : the player in the middle becomes a slice of bread, and
her neighbors become the toaster, by `building` the toaster with their arms
around the bread.  The slice of bread pops up an down too when done!

button are not defined.

 The other player enters and asks if he can play with the box.  Player 1
agrees, but adds something like Whatever you do, don`t push the red button.

 Player 2 begins to play with the buttons, controlling player 2.  Then,
we slowly work up to the use of the dreaded red button, which will make
player 2 do something not-so-obvious.  This can be anything, but it should 
not be preconceived.  The red button might become a Mood swing button, 
a Start Screaming, Start Giggling, Sing Opera, or Switch-to-  Gibberish

 Description 

This one starts just like  Free Association Circle : players in a 
circle, establish a rhythm, and freely associate on previous player`s word.
As this is going on, the trainer will tap all players gently on the shoulder, at 3 times:

 first tap: players close their eyes but 
continue the free association, sticking to the rhythm
 second tap: everyone starts walking around (carefully!), eyes still closed.Players have to 
recognize the voice of their ex-neighbour in the circle to know when 
it`s their turn.
 Third tap: all players, still eyes closed, and still associating, try to reconstruct the circle.


Exercise is over when everyone is in a circle again.  Trainer should keep an eye
on players to make sure they don`t 
run into things.  It helps if there`s not too much clutter around, of course."

 Description 

One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a 
couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor).  The 
idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through
the room, by talking.  



Also known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name 
`Airplane`: The blindfoldee (or just eyes
closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors.
He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic
Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a
chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane
also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) to
reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed
two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a
direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may
step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly
forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be
given from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling
directors. You can also destroy all the trust you`ve built up in your
class by completely clearing 
the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us,
someone will suggest it.

agreement), so initially you probably want to take it easy on the silly stuff, like line up by
order 
of mental health...

 Always interesting to see what strategies the group comes up with.

 You can`t really use alphabetical order if the group does not really know 
each other."

 Description 

Excellent exercise to get to know each other, and to learn to trust and touch each other. 
5 volunteers.  4 of these must try and hide the fifth person, using nothing but their bodies.  
The other students stand around the group and try and see pieces of the fifth`s clothes, shoes, 
skin.

 
It`s great fun for the other students to watch and try and find uncovered pieces of person.
Don`t tell them they go next, with one person less.

 Variations 

Try this game with less and less `hiders`.  If the task becomes impossible, tell them they can
use parts of walls.  Using a corner is easiest, of course, but let them figure that out 
themselves."

 Description  
Silly game, inspired by a Korean TV show (so we`re told).
 4 players, 3 stand with their ears closed, backs turned to the scene.
The 4th player gets as a suggestion  a common expression.
 The idea is 
that this player has 1 minute to communicate this suggestion
to the 2nd player, using only mime and  Gibberish .  Number 2 then
communicates (what he has understood) to number 3, who does the same to number
4.  At the end yell Bong Bong Bong and have players 2, 3 and 4 explain what
they thought they understood.

 Description 

One player starts the exercise by miming his location (interacting with objects, furniture...). As soon as it's clear where this person is, a second player comes on. This person establishes the relationship between them in a single sentence ( 'Mother, I'm sorry I'm a little late.'). The first person then presents a problem, preferably through miming or in a single sentence. A third player then enters the scene to fix the problem through miming or in a single sentence. As soon as the problem is fixed, all three players shout 'TADAAA!' accompanied by an appropriate gesture (show hands).


This is a good exercise to remind players to establish relationships early on, create problems which are relevant to the given setting and to resolve them without delays."

 Description 

2 players play an improvized interrogation scene.  One is the interrogator, the other is 
a suspect.  The interrogator randomly throws unconnected elements to the
suspect, who needs to incorporate these and get himself into (even more) 
trouble.

 And then we have Boris, who is a nasty, huge, but invisible thug assisting the interrogator.
Every time the interrogator does not like the suspect`s answers (and also when
the suspect does not incriminate himself enough), the interrogator calls on 
Boris to torture the suspect, prodding 
him to confess or incriminate him
even further.

 Notes 

 we do not establish the crime beforehand
 the suspect mimes being tortured by Boris
 the investigator can tell Boris what to do (break his leg), but it is more
fun to leave the choice of torture up to the suspect
 if the torture does not go far enough to the investigator`s taste, he can 
always call in Boris` evil twin brother, Igor (also invisible)
 as a gag, the suspect can also incriminate Boris (who can turn out to be 
a witness/accomplice to the crime).

 Description 

Extremely silly game, to pump up the energy.
Get everyone in a circle.  One player becomes the body of a bunny - this is 
done by holding both arms in front of your chest, elbows touching your rib
cage, and letting hands hang.  Her 2 neighbors become the `ears` of the bunny, 
by waving a hand next to the middle player`s ears.  All 3 say `bunny bunny 
bunny` together, until the middle player `throws` a `bunny` to another player
in the circle.  This player becomes the bunny body, and his neighbors get
to do the ears.

 Play this game at a high speed.  Mumbling `bunny bunny` en masse gives 
a nice energy boost.


 Variations 

Play in slow motion.  Hilarious!



Alternatively, you can really invent any object or create or replace the bunny, as long as 
you invent a sound along with it.  Try
r

 a car, with 2 wheels and a set of wind screen wipers, going `vroom vroom`
 a cow, with an udder and 2 horns, going `moo moo`
 a washing machine, with 2 players building a `box` with both arms, and the middle player waving her arms in a circle in front of her.  All go `rumble rumble`
 an elephant, with 2 big ears and a trunk, making an elephant sound (if you
don`t know what an elephant sounds like, just invent a sound).

 Status


 Description 

Excellent  Status improv game.

 

4 players.  Ask an audience member to pick 4 cards out of a deck, and attach a card to each 
player`s forehead, so that players can see each other`s card, but not their own.    Use a rubber band or a piece of string for that.

 The idea is to improvize a scene, in which the status order of the characters is defined by the
cards.  Evidently, players don`t know their own status, so the other players 
will have to endow 
them.

 Notes 

Set up a location where status is important.  Examples would be a Royal Palace or a highly organized
bureaucracy (the White House ?).

 Variations 

 players can only see their own card, but not the others`
 give players multiple cards, and let them switch cards in the middle of the 
scene.  Statuses (statii ??) should change accordingly.
 as an exercise, let players play a scene and then ask them to line up
in status order to see if they `got` their status right."

 Description 

This is a variation on  Greatest Hits , for those over 30 (those under 30 never bought CDs in a physical shop, we fear).  Setting is a CD shop, one player is the sales person, the other is a client.  Audience suggestion is someone to buy a present for, or an occasion to buy a present.  Say graduating medical school.  The buyer is looking for an appropriate CD to buy for this person/occasion.

 The seller presents several CDs, each CD gets an explicit style/artist, and the seller offers to demo an appropriate song. E.g. for the graduation, How about a Lady Gaga album?  Her new album  is called Doctor Love and it has this great song Measles.  One or more other players (and preferably a musician) then perform the song.

 After 3-4 songs the buyer agrees to buy the album and scene ends."

 Description 

This improv game is called Location, Career, Death (LCD).

 One player on stage, the others off stage.  The audience provides a location, 
an occupation and an object, only known to the player on stage.  Second player enters and a scene is played in gibberish.  Player one needs to communicate the location 
to player 2; as soon as player 2 thinks he`s got it, her claps his hands and spins 
around.  Then player 2 needs to guess the occupation; clap and spin when you think
you got it.  Finally, the object needs to be revealed.  As soon as player 2 has the
object, he needs to kill player 1 with it.

 Then the next player comes on stage and the game recommences, until all players
have played.  Afterwards, line up the players and ask them where they think they
were, what their occupation was and what the murder weapon was - usually quite far
off the original suggestion, much 
to the audience`s amusement.





Also known as LOW. (Location, Occupation, Weapon).  Also known as Chain Murder. 
See also  Hijacker for a similar game without the  Gibberish component.

 Variations 

Use a bell, every 10 seconds or so; at the bell players need to clap and spin
and proceed to the next step, even if they are not sure about the where, who and 
what.  Kind of LCD on speed."

 Description 

Great exercise to develop characters. Players mill about the room as themselves. Ask the players to find some sort of inspiration, and then they should use that to change their walk. Anything can be used as inspiration: use an emotion (happy!), an occupation (farmer!), a stereotype (Irish!), an animal (Snake!) or even an object (grandfather clock!). 

 Next, turn the way you are walking into a character.  Explore how the character walks and - by  Association - figure out as much as possible about this character.

Then the pairs will get into the correct formation.

Each of the three chivalrous couples has its own formation that goes with it. The Knight and Queen's formation is one person as the Knight down on one knee and the other person as the Queen sitting on the Knight's knee. The Prince and Princess formation is one person as the Prince will have the the other person, the Princess, in their arms. 
The Horse and Rider formation is the Horse will be standing up and the Rider will be riding piggy-back on the Horse.

 Association
 Exercise

 Description 

This one is like a  Free Association Circle , except that the rhythm is more
explicit.  Here`s how to do the rhythm: each beat consists of 4 phases:

 Slap both hands on your thighs
 Clap your hands
 Snap your left hand fingers
 Snap your right hand fingers


With every right hand snap, a word should be thrown to your neighbor.  Once the rhythm is established, you can leave out the snaps - that`ll make things more 
understandable.

 Variations 


You can use this for both  Last Letter games or  Free Association Circle .
 Try this with two circles. Have one circle associate freely, and another
circle on  Last Letter .  Whenever a player misses a beat she should switch
circles.

 Notes 

If you do this with 2 circles, you will probably find that the rhythms for both
circles synchronize."

"This improv game is called Click Bang you`re dead and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Concentration
 Exercise
 Icebreakers


 Description 
Description: all players sit in a circle.  Only one 
player should know how to 
play and what the secret is; this player is the leader at first, until others 
catch on.  This person points at random people in the circle each time saying 
either click or bang; they should make it sound and look like what 
they are doing has to do with math or the order they are going etc.

The secret: it really doesn't matter who is pointed to, what is said, when 
they are pointed to, who it begins with or who it ends with, it just depends 
on who speaks first after the clicks and bangs are done.  So the person who 
begins (the one that knows what's going on) will declare whoever talks first 
dead by saying you're dead.  That person isn't out or anything, it's 
just for effect.  The game continues until the players catch on.  If somebody 
thinks they get it, the leader gives them a chance to say the clicks and 
bangs and they get to announce who is dead; the leader will then be able to 
tell if they understand the secret if they 
announce the right person as 
being dead.

Make sure that once the players begin to catch on, they don't spoil it for 
the others by letting the cat out of the bag.  Also, the game is best if 
played with ten or more people.

 Long Form
 Narration
 Performance


 Description 

Cloud Atlas is a book by author David Mitchell, which has a peculiar structure.  The same structure can be used to create a Long Form improv show.  For details on the book (spoiler alert) see  the book's wikipedia page.
 Here is how the format works: it is a long form show with an intermission.  Before the break, a number of stories (6 stories in the original book, but any number above 2 will work) are half told; these stories take place in history, time running forward, and each story is played in a particular, different style.  After the break, the stories are finished, one after the other, but in inverse order.  By the end of the show, the stories should have connections between them.

  An example to clarify.  Ask 4 suggestions of historical periods & locations, in historical order.  The (near & far) future are allowed.  Suppose we get: french revolution, first world war Britain, today (2013-ish) USA and 2030 China.  This will lead to 4 story lines, and 8 parts, 4 before the break and 4 after.  Each story line is played as a  Straight Story .  For example:

 Story 1/part 1: Dramatic story in france during revolution
 Story 2/part 1: Love story during WW1
 Story 3/part 1: Thriller in USA, current time
 Story 4/part 1: Musical in post-communist China
 Break
 Second half of story 4
 Second part of story 3
 Second half of story 2
 Second part of story 1

 There should be a link from story 1 to story 2, one from story 2 to story 3 and one from story 3 to story 4.  All the links should be different in kind and not be purely thematic, e.g. a book written by a character in story 1 may be important in story 2; an invention done in story 2 may be linked to a character's profession in story 3 and so forth.   If one link is a character the other links should not be characters.  Ideally, not all links are established before the break.  For a really concrete example see the wikipedia link on the plots in Mitchell's book.

their left hands up and down.  Have player 1 start; when her arm is up she
shouts/throws a number.  The player with that number needs to throw another 
nnumber at the next beat.


Players that fail (if they did not recognize their own number) or that break 
the rhythm become the last player in the circle, and that changes the numbers
for a bunch of players.  Restart with player one.  See also  Big Booty ."

Not exactly theater but fun when played well.  The MC gets a bunch of 
`confessions` from the audience.  These can be really lame, like e.g. 
`I vote democratic`, `I used to be a man`, `I sold a kidney`, whatever.

Then players line up.  One player steps forward, and gets a confession from
the host.  Player utters the confession in a character, and immediately another 
player jumps in and offers a witty reply.  Do this as long as players have ideas
for replies.  Then replace the first player by a new one, give her a new 
confession and repeat ad libitum."
"This improv game is called Consciences and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories:

				An improvized scene is played, which any player can stop at any time by yelling freeze.  At that point, the
player steps out of the scene, and tells the audience what his character is really thinking, 
after which the scene continues.  The other characters of course are not supposed to know what
players are thinking, but the players do, and should use this.

 Notes 

Players can use this to reveal their hidden motives.  Other players can play into this, or purposely ignore this knowledge.   

 Gimmick: characters may actually have other things on their minds than what`s going on in the
scene.  E.g. a driver stopped by a cop may be thinking about the groceries
 his wife told him to get at the
supermarket.

Everyone in a circle.  One person (A) starts by calling another person`s name

 Description 

Excellent game for building characters and group-storytelling.


4 players, ask the audience who they are, what their occupation would be.


These 4 characters have died together, and they are going to tell us how that came about.
Players line up.  The 
game is played in 3 rounds.  In every round, each player offers some information about how
they happened to die.  At the end of the thirds round, they should all be dead.

 Notes 

It`s fun to take risks - if in the first round each of the players just offers what they happened 
to be doing the day they died, and where.  It is quite a challenge to get these 4 stories together,
including the deaths of all characters, by the end of the third round.

"This improv game is called Deconstruction and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 

This is a  Long Form format.  It starts with one rather long scene, 
which is followed by other, probably shorter, scenes that somehow connect to
the first scene.  Possible connections are:

 Characters return
 Characters of situations mentioned in the first scene appear in the 
subsequent scenes
 Subsequent scenes take place in the same environment as the first scene

 The reason why the first scene should be fairly long is that it should
provide enough information for other scenes to build on.  The name 
`Deconstruction` can be interpreted as Take a first scene, and then 
deconstruct it by using characters, locations, situations, played or referred
to, and play/re-use those in further scenes.

 Origin 

Deconstruction originated at ImprovOlympic in Chicago.

 Description 

4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them.  The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in
front.  Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left).  So now we have a 
different combination of players in front.  These 2 get an audience suggestion.  Turn again and ask for suggestion
again and do this once more.  Then have players take their original position.

  The game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the
side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells Call, at which time all players step back to their
original positions in the square.  MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns 
accordingly.  The 2 players in front
start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again.

 This is repeated.  When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously 
played scene.  They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later,
a century later). Also known as Revolver. Also known as Pan Left Pan Right. Also known as Turntable."

 Spontaneity


 Description 

A scene is played.  Whenever the MC ring a bell (or yells `Ding`), 
the player that is doing
something/saying something needs to say/do something else.

 Notes 

Doing `something else` is quite often interpreted as doing/saying the 
opposite of what you did before.  One can be more creative, e.g. repeat
what was said in a different emotion.



If you use this as an exercise on  Spontaneity the trainer can `Ding`
quite often (very frustrating for the players, 
but they will come up with
stuff they never would have thought of before).  Disadvantage of this is that
the story/characters tend to get lost.  Use sparingly for performance.

This is like  Ding : players play a scene.  When a bell is rang, they both

"This improv game is called Disaster Movie and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Long Form


				This is a  Long Form format that can be played with a large number of players.

 Audience suggests a type of disaster (flood, earthquake, alien invasion, you name it) and a location where the play will unfold, preferably a location where lots of characters can be found.  Examples are a tropical tourist paradise, a big building.

 The story starts right before the disaster, usually some character foreseeing the disaster, discovering a bad omen or some foretelling sign.

 Next we see lots of characters in the given location.  These should be the archetypical characters one finds in typical disaster movies.  Examples are:

 An old couple that have been together for ever (they will die)
 A priest who might lead the survivors (he will die)
 A wacko scientist who will have a miracle solution to escape the disaster (he will die)
 A fallen-down hero, a die-hard ex-cop thrown out of the force, a retired fireman, an ex life-guard with a coke habit, you get the 
picture.  He will rise up to the occasion and survive.
 A kid with loving parents (or a troubled teen not getting along with the parents) (the kid will survive, the parents will die
 Some sort of troubled, dysfunctional character set up to become the lover of the hero.
 Watch some disaster movies and pick your favorite cliche characters. 

 Next, disaster strikes.  Light, sound and smoke effects are a must.  Why not use a musician with electric distortion guitar for added color.

 The following scenes show the characters in their quest to survive.  Most will die (spectacularly).  Feel free to provide background on the characters using flashbacks.

 Story ends with the hero + lover + kid (if available and/or still alive) escaping the carnage, ready and set to live happily ever after."

restore the balance.  The new player becomes the new leader, and the previous
leader becomes a follower.

 As soon as the balance is restored, the leader can start walking around; the other player stays where he is.  As soon as the leader stops again, the follower(s) move and restore the balance.  After that, the leader becomes one of the 
followers, and a new leader jumps in.

balance that way.

 Description 

Two players stand a few feet apart facing each other and have the most boring 4-line interchange possible. They then each secretly pick a specific distance they want to be from the other person and repeat the interchange while maintaining the distance. The maintaining of distance automatically seems to affect people`s emotional commitment and inflection. The key is 
to have a specific distance in mind down to the inch. If one person picks 1 foot but the other picks a foot and a half. You will see some interesting conflict because of that extra half a foot.

 Performance
 SingSong


 Description 

This is another structured long form.  Get a topic, line up the players, and start
improvising a song around the theme, usually without using a piano player (it
would get too structured and cluttered if you so).  Use the suggestion to improvise
instruments (or their sound) with.  Players can offer bits of  Narrative by
singing over the `music`.  Once the narrative patterns are clean, any player can
step out of the song and start a scene based on what was established.  

 When the scene is done the `music` resumes till someone else starts a scene.
Nice if the scenes start to connect, or if characters from different scenes meet
and interact.

 Notes 

This is a bit like a  Harold but without the games.  Or like a 
 French Braid where the glue between the scenes is the song."

 Description 

Excellent introductory exercise for building environments and  Platform .  All players in 2 
rows.   2 facing
players play the exercise, the others watch.



Player 1 sets a (part of a) platform by miming a door.  As soon as player 2 has
an idea 
about where player 1 might be, player 2 steps into the scene and offers
a line of dialog, expressing where we are.  Player 2 answers player 1, 
acknowledging player 1`s offer.  This ends the scene.

 The audience should know after these 2 lines of dialog where the players
are, and who they are, or what their relationship is to one another.

 Notes 

`Doors` can be anything that separates one physical location from another.  
Players can mime real doors, but also gates, curtains, you name it.  Encourage 
players to try out as many types of `doors` as possible.  Use sound to 
enhance the platform, e.g. a door in a submarine makes a different kind of
noise than an elevator door.

 Description 

Another great game to train listening skills.



Pick a place where a scene will be played, and 2 players.   Tell each player what they need to get the
other player to do, without the other player knowing this.  Players are not allowed to explicitly
 tell the other
player what to do.



Example: an arena in ancient Rome.  Player 1 needs player 2 to taste the sand in the arena, and player
2 needs to get player 1 
to tie a knot in a lion`s tail.

 Notes 

Works best is players take risks.  If they to the `wrong` thing the audience 
will probably just laugh, and that should be enough to signal the player he`s
going the wrong way."

"This improv game is called Elements and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 

This is a  Long Form handle for a 2-part show.


Get (or prepare) a suggestion for a movie style.  This needs to be very specific.  E.g. 'action movie' is too general.  'Superhero movie' is better. Disaster movie is fine as well.  You can even pick a director-based style, like 'Tarantino', but then it should be a director that have a very clear style.  Steven Spielberg for example has done too many movies in too many different styles and that is not going to work.

 Get from the audience as many elements that are typical for this style. Think about the characters we typically see in these kinds of movies, their occupations, and typical situations.  Write down all suggestions - you'll need 20-30 of them.

 Part one is just a collage of scenes, unrelated to one another, that might be part of a typical movie in the style chosen, and based on the elements provided by the audience.

 After the intermission, the audience gets to choose the scene they liked best.  You re-play the scene.  The audience need to help the cast remember things they might have missed.

 And then you play the whole movie, in which the original scene is 'somewhere' - i.e. the original scene should not be the start of the movie (but it might be the final scene)."

 Description 

This one is like an extended version of  Bippety Bop(1) .  Start with 3 things:


 an Elephant, consisting of a trunk, made by the middle player, by holding your nose with one hand, and extending your other arm through the arm that holds the hand that holds the nose (does this make any sense?).
The neighboring players each form a big ear, using both arms.  Don`t forget to attach the ears to the
elephant`s head. Make an 
elephant sound.
 A palm tree: the middle player is the tree, her neighbors become the waving leaves of the tree.  Make windy noise
 A car: the middle player holds the steering wheel, the neighbors do the 
wheels.  Make car engine noise.


One player in the middle.  Point to a person and yell Elephant (or Palm Tree, or whatever was agreed).  Then choose another player
and yell something else.  Do this at high speed.

 Now for the extension: when someone makes a mistake, look at what the person does, and add that to the list of possibilities.  For
example, someone might be waving their arms incorrectly in from of them, trying to build the trunk of the elephant.  If the group 
things this resembles, say, a swimmer, we decide on adding a swimmer to the list of options.  Say the middle player does the arms and
her neighbor do the legs.

"This improv game is called Emotional Manipulation and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Accepting
 Exercise
 Performance
 Trust


 Description 

This is a great  Accepting exercise, but it demands a certain level of  Trust . This can also be used as a technique during  Performance .

 The idea is to open a 2 player scene with a line of dialog that manipulates the other player's emotional state. This can be positive (Gee Robin, you look handsome today) or negative (Mary, have you been snacking again lately, I think you've gained even more weight).  Player 2 should accept this manipulation, and let it change the emotional state of her character.

 We mentioned  Trust : it should be clear to the players that we are manipulating the emotions of characters, not the players themselves.  Furthermore, the word 'manipulation' may have a negative connotation for some - this is merely a technique, not intended to make others feel bad/sad/manipulated.  Do not use this exercise unless the players have developed a great deal of trust; if this exercise makes a player uncomfortable, then stop the exercise. 

 Variations 

This can be done as a one-person exercise as well: have the player say or do something that will manipulate her own character's emotional state.

 Another variation is to blurt out dialog to which the emotional reaction cannot be predicted (Honey I'm pregnant) - but also in that case player 2 should react with a change in emotion.  E.g. happy: That's so wonderful baby, we've been trying for such a long time. Versus mad: You silly cow, don't tell me you forgot your birth control pills again. Versus sad: That makes me think of poor little Jimmy again, I miss him so much.

"This improv game is called Excluding and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Exercise
 Group


 Description 

4 players play a scene, in which one of the players gets excluded.  

 Notes 

This is a group exercise, in the sense that players should be sensing where the majority of the group is going (see  Alien Tiger Cow ).

Tell players not to be afraid of `being nasty` - be extreme in your exclusion (that makes it easier, also for the
player that is excluded - see  Mr. Nice Guy ).  Whoever gets excluded should 
gladly accept this and react accordingly.

Excluded players can go to extremes to be re-included - hilariously funny if even this is thoroughly ignored by the others.

 Variations 

Let the exclusion evolve; allow a player that got excluded to get 2 others to join him and exclude the fourth one.  
This only works if the excluded player first allows herself to be excluded (a little  Chivalry here).

 Also known as Alliances. . This game was originally created as a pattern game for 
long form shows at the Theatresports London Impro Lab in the late 1980`s.  
The whole point of the game is NOT to actively try and exclude anyone.  
The exclusion of one player should happen as a result of the other players 
making alliances with one another.  If you don`t do this the scene doesn`t form
 very good patterns and the players get too competitive.   
You also miss the slow, sliding status drops and the desperate attempts to 
hook into an existing alliance, that happen when a player is starting to 
nrealize that they are being excluded.

A good way to start this game would be:

 Start in a black-out seated round a table

 While the lights are still down the entire ensemble starts to laugh (as if someone has just told the punchline to a hilarious joke)

 The lights slowly fade up as the cast`s laughter winds down and the alliances begin to form

 By the end of the scene, which climaxes in a final, dramatic exclusion, we 
usually end up with four to six threads and a clear protagonist

"This improv game is called Faces and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Characters
 Long Form


				This is a  Long Form that starts with a number of monologues, each based on a character created from a picture of a face, projected on stage.

 Assemble a series of pictures of faces, make sure the players do not get to see these before the performance.  Pick 3-5 players, and randomly assign a face to each player.  Audience provides input about the face, e.g. name of the character, motivations, desires, social background etc.   The player then introduces the character in a monologue, building upon the image as well as the audience suggestions.


Once all main characters have been introduced in the monologues, a series of scenes are played in which the characters that were introduced play the main 
parts.   Players who play a 'faced' character do not play other characters, but auxiliary players may play side characters (and may play more than one character)."

"This improv game is called Fast Food Laban and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Characters
 Exercise


 Description 

Laban was a movement theorist, and this exercise is 
based on (a simplified 
form of some of) his ideas.  Take 3 categories:

 Timing: Sudden or Sustained
 Weight: Heavy or Light
 Space: Direct or Indirect


Then try and make characters that behave/speak following combinations of
the 3 categories:

 punching : sudden / heavy / direct
 slashing : sudden / heavy / indirect
 wringing : sustained / heavy / indirect
 stroking : sustained / light / indirect
 dabbing : sudden / light / direct
 smoothing : sustained / light / direct
 pushing : sustained / heavy / direct

 Notes 

The attributes go with the characters, not necessarily with the actual performer`s body.  A heavyset person may move about delicately.

 Variations 

You can introduce this in a fairly simple way, by asking the players to move 
about the room, according to directions or orientations:

 be a `horizontal` or `vertical` person
 be downward, or upward
 be light or heavy



Then 
experiment with these: be suddenly light (bird taking off from a tree) or 
continuously light (be a cloud).

 You can do this using different kinds of music.  What direction / weight /
movement does a certain song or theme inspire?

 Then try to experiment with characters: who or what would be vertical person
be (a general?).  What/how would be continuously light person be (stoned?).  
Suddenly light (flirty?).  See also  Fast Food Stanislawski .

 Exercise


 Description 

Have 2 players perform a scene, perhaps give them a title or a location, but
also give them a subtext for their character.  Subtexts might be:

 you want to seduce the other
 you are a nerd
 you like to make people laugh
 you want to impress others
 you are a nasty person
 you try to be ordinary
 you are an optimist/pessimist
 
you will never find a girlfriend/boyfriend

 Notes 
 If you are using this in a workshop it might be a good idea to ask the
players how one would behave given a certain subtext.  Stress that you are 
looking for  Truthfulness .

 This is an excellent technique to find a character.  You can actually
use this for performance - just give yourself a subtext when you jump onto
the stage and see what happens.

Also known as Rewind. See also  Director`s Cut ."
"This improv game is called Fast Montage and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Format
 Long Form
 Narration
 Performance


 Description 

Not to be confused with the generic format  Montage . A Fast Montage is a technique to provide some  Backstory .  It works as follows: when a character makes a statement about her past, which is not already evident from the story so far, a series of  Flashbacks are played to illustrate the dynamics of the information about that past.  When done, the narrative continues from where it was before the Fast Montage.

 As an example: suppose a beggar makes the statement I used to be a rock star, a Fast Montage may show how the character become a rock star, and what happened to the rock star so that she is now a beggar.  This might start with a flashback to the character's puberty, and continue from there on:

 a quick scene where she hears someone play the guitar and decides she'll learn to play too
 a quick scene where her boyfriend tells her she should try and publish the song she just performed
 a quick scene where she celebrates her first record deal
 a quick scene where she gives her thankyou speach for winning her first grammy
 a quick scene where she is snorting coke and partying hard
 a quick scene where she gets arrested at an airport for drug possession
 and so on, further scenes that document her decline

 In the succession of the flashbacks time runs forward linearly - he montage progresses logically forward through time.  It is also important that the scenes are very short; the only purpose is to establish the next step in the character's story.   Edit s between scenes should be fluent and organic and are typically not initiated by the main character (like a  Revolving Door Edit ).  The scenes should definitely *not* introduce other key characters - this is a montage about  one character's past.  And as soon as the montages have established the necessary  Backstory to explain the character's current situation or state of mind, the main story continues."

All players, except one, the victim, form a long line.  The first player in the line throws
any word to the victim, who responds as fast as he/she can with the first word that comes to
mind.  The next player in the line then throws another word, usually unrelated to the 
previous word, and again the victim needs to respond as fast as possible.  Repeat till 
everyone has thrown a word.

 Variations 

This can be done as a continuation game: when done, the victim takes last place in the line, and the first player becomes the victim.
  You can even have multiple victims walking the line at the same time.  Make sure there is enough `space` between the victims, otherwise, with the first hesitation, victims will
start bumping into one another."

r
5-4-3-2-1 can be played with 4 to 12 players. In this format the audience provides 5 different themes, objects, emotions, locations or situations. Then, the game is played in 5 rounds.

In the first round 5 scenes are played, each based on one of the audience suggestions. These scenes are totally unrelated. After the first round the audience decides which of the 5 scenes seen should be discontinued.

In the second round, the 4 remaining scenes are continued, and links start to appear between these scenes. Again, after this, the audience decides which scene to dump.

This continues until after 4 rounds there are only 2 scenes left. In the fifth round these scenes come together in one final scene. 
This format can be played with or without props and/or director(s).

 Description 

CopyCat goes like a verbal  Freeze Tag .  A scene is started.  At any 
time, a player at the side can step forward (the playing players hold off
for a moment) and repeats a line that was said in the scene.  Whoever 
originally said that line, steps aside, and the remaining players start 
a new scene starting with the line that was repeated.

 Variations 

Feel free to 
actually continue the ongoing scene rather than to start a 
completely new one.  Feel free to replace all the players instead of just
the player who said the last line.

 Rather than just stepping in and repeating a line, you might want to
call `FLIP` (or freeze).  This variation is known as Also known as FLIP. ."
"This improv game is called Flock Dance and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Exercise
 Icebreakers
 Warm-up


 Description 

This is a physical warm-up.  
The group forms a pyramid: one player becomes 
the top, 2 players behind her, 3 players on a third line, and so on.


The top player starts moving about the room (perhaps use music to guide
 the players).  The second line follows the first player, and mimics her movements, and the third line follows the second line.

The top player can alternate however she wants (and can be guided with e.g. a 
change in the music).  



The top player can even turn around, and face the second line.  Confusion will
be complete.  Other variations can happen when the top player bumps into the 
last line, and takes over their movements.

 Description 

All but one in a circle, one player in the middle.  The middle player closes
her eyes, and the rest of the group quietly chooses a leader.


Middle player opens her eyes and tries to find the leader.  The whole group
follows the leader, in everything he 
does.  As soon as the middle player
finds out who the leader was the game is over.


This only works if 
movements are clear, not too fast, and if the group `follows the leader` as 
fast and as precisely as possible."
"This improv game is called Follow the Leaver and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Long Form


				Start a scene with at least 2 characters. This is long form, so feel free to edit to different scenes, in different time periods.  Each player sticks to playing one character.

 whenever a character leaves the scene, the audience may yell follow the leaver.  At this point all characters remaining on stage disappear, and the story continues with the character who just left the scene, and a totally different story line is allowed to develop.  Characters from the previous scene do not appear in this next scene and the players may play different characters (except for the leaver').  This continues until one of the characters leaves and 
the audience yells follow the leaver.


Typically characters from older scenes do not return, though this is not a rule  set in stone; the format really allows sequential story lines that do not connect later on.

 Warm-up


 Description 

One person is 'it'. Pair up others so one they are side by side touching one foot to the other on that side. The pairs swap names and the person who is 'it' (standing in one spot - they can't move) calls out a name. The newly named person must run over to them without getting tagged by the real named person. If tagged they return to the pair. If they get away they join the 'it' person (and swap names) and the partnerless person is now the new 'it' person and calls out names.


When a name is called and the wrong person runs they have have to return to where they were standing in the pair AND IF the person who was supposed to run is still within tagging distance OR if they walk to close to tagging distance they can be tagged then. The tagger can not chase the person but often in the confusion the runner stays within tagging distance for a while.


Make sure pairs are away from walls and furniture because often the runner leaps away to avoid getting tagged and you want to avoid crashing into anything or anyone."

 Description 

This is the classic association exercise.  There are various ways of playing
this (see Variations and see other games in the  Association category.

  The Basics 
 In a free association we will ask players to say the first thing they
think about when hearing (or seeing, feeling, smelling or tasting) anything
another player provides.
 
 It should be stressed that anything is valid, as long as it is not
 preconceived: the association should be based on what the previous player
has offered.

Everyone in a circle and we establish a rhythm, by swinging a hand.  Once a rhythm is established, one player starts by tossing a word to his neighbor, who
associates on the word and tosses another word to his neighbor.




It`s 
important to stay in the rhythm.  Tell the players to just say `banana` if
they feel they can`t think of a word, as long as the rhythms does not get broken.

 Variations

"This improv game is called Free Association Lines and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Association
 Exercise


 Description 

Yet another way to play association games.  Place all players on 2 lines,
facing each other.  One player starts walking to another player in the other
line.  Just before he gets to that other player, he throws her a word.  The
receiver starts crossing the line towards someone else, and the first player
takes her place in the line.  The receiver now becomes the thrower, throwing
the first word she can think of to another player, who then starts walking, and so on.

 Variations 

Try with 2 or more walkers at the same time.   Many players, especially new
ones, tend to find it easier to freely associate when there are multiple 
walkers: they feel less `on the spot` (as no-one is watching them in all
the commotion) and they don`t really have the time 
to get in their heads.

Nice, but a bit dangerous exercise to build trust.  In it`s simplest (and 
safest) form all players stand in a circle, one player in the middle.  The 
player in the middle closes her eyes, slowly turns around, and then lets 
herself fall backwards (or forwards).  The other players need to catch her.

, the others in front
of him.  Player closes his eyes and lets himself fall, hopefully he will be
caught by the others."

Free-form is what it says on the box: improv with no rules.  This typically refers to narrative  Long Form without a particular format: just ask for a suggestion and start playing scenes.

2 actors start an improvized scene.  At any point in time another player can call Freeze.
This player then tags out one of the 2 actors, and takes his place.  Both
players then start a new scene, justifying their positions.

 Notes 

The way this improv 
game is played quite often goes a bit against good improv, as many groups hardly
take the time to develop a story line.  If played this way, it`s more a game of wit, and you
would probably use it early in a show as an audience (and player) warm-up.


Alternatively, you can take your time and play every scene for several minutes, see what
develops, and only at the end of each scene tag into another scene.

 Description 

This is a very simple format, which consists of a number of (unrelated) scenes,

It is played as follows: 2 or more players start a scene.  At any time, when 
another player or players enters the stage, the scene is interrupted (or fades out) and the new player(s) start a new scene.  This is repeated until all players
nhave played.  


Then the series is restarted with the first scene.  This scene continues, or 
starts at a later point in time (or later in the story, like a  Fast Forward ).  The scene gets interrupted again, and so forth.

 The whole is repeated several times.

 This is typically played without a director - the players decide when to
interrupt an ongoing scene.  Players typically play one character."

 Description 

This is best played with an odd number of players.  Everyone in a circle.  The

 Variations 

The receiver can provide 
both the translation, and a new gibberish word.



You may want to add the origin of the language along with the translation.

 Notes 

Any gibberish word might be translated as `banana` of course, but that is 
not the idea of the exercise.  For your translation, use the first thing that
comes to mind.  You may be inspired by the whole sound of the word (it might
sound like something `known`), or parts of the word (only the vowels, or only
the consonants), or by the intonation of the `giver`, or even by her expression
or body language. 


Try gibberish in different `languages` or `accents`.

 Description 

Great high-tempo exercise.  1 player up front.  He`s the goalie.  The other players all think of an opening
line for a scene, and a character.  When everyone has their opening line and character, we bombard the goalie
with these offers, one at a time.  Goalie needs to react right away to an offer, acknowledging the opening and
character, snap into an opposite character and reply 
to the opening.  Immediately after that the next player comes 
up with his or her offer.


This exercise is good for teaching players to react right away, and to snap into a character almost without thinking."

The players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience,  Based on
a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their 
own character in that story.

 The play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself.  The 
order in which characters speak is not really important, as long as they all speak.

 After the introductions, things start to happen.  Every character reflects on
what is happening from their own perspective, and each character adds elements to 
the story.

 Keep going (and make sure that every character keeps contributing) and 

 Reincorporating as long as things stay interesting.

"This improv game is called Gorilla Theatre and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Format


 Description 

This format is played with 3 experienced players, one MC and another 
player, 
dressed up as a Gorilla. The Gorilla is the prize to be won; the best player 
of the evening gets to spend a week with the Gorilla, and of course this is 
quite a privilege!

The Gorilla enters with last week`s winning player (real or faked). The MC
 explains that the score for the evening will be counted by means of bananas; 
the player that end up with most bananas at the end of the game wins another 
week with the Gorilla. 

The audience is trained to `vote` by yelling `Banana` (for a good performance) 
or something else, like `Die` or `Forfeit` for a bad performance. 

Each scene is then played by 2 players, and directed by the third. The 
beauty of it all is the fact that not the players are judged by the audience,
 but the director. 

Players take turns directing, and after each game the audience either awards
 the director a banana, or a forfeit. Bananas are pinned on a scoreboard, 
or pinned onto the winning player`s 
costume - cardboard bananas are preferable
 in the latter case. 

A forfeit is like a punishment for a poorly directed scene. Possible forfeits 
might be calling your mom and explaining why you`ve been such a lousy 
director, or having to sing a song about your bad scene. 

The director gets to choose the scene or the game to be played. Perhaps a 
list of games to be played this night is on the stage, and directors can 
write their names next to the games they want to direct. The director
 directs the scene, gives players side-coachings, can interrupt the scene, 
introduce tilts or make the players repeat (part of) the scene. To ensure 
that bad scenes don`t drag on forever, or to prevent directors to play 
tons of 30-second scenes in order to improve their chances, certain troupes 
limit the amount of time for directing to like 20 minutes per player.

This format can be played with or without attributes and props. The Gorilla 
might even be used as 
a prop, or even as a player, although the Gorilla 
should not try and steal the show. The Gorilla is a player, so he too 
should be prepared to take risks, and he`s supposed to be naughty.



This is a fairly advanced format, as the players not only need to play well, 
they also need enough insight to effectively direct scenes. This is also a 
rather nice format, as players are not rewarded; 2 players playing well 
together generate a banana for the director, and this way the format 
prevents competition between the players.

 Description 

This game was made famous by the TV show Who'se line is is anyways.  Typically played with 4 players.  2 of these are the hosts of a tv commercial, trying to sell a CD compilation of 'greatest hits'.  Audience suggestion is the theme of the CD.  E.g. a profession: accountants.  The CD to be sold is then Songs for Accountants. 

 (for all you digital kids, instead of a CD it might just as well be a record in the iTunes store). 

 The hosts discuss the CD, why viewers should buy it, and select 3-4 tracks. Each track gets a title and a style, e.g. (for accountants) The IRS blue - which in this case also implies the style.  The other players then improvise that song, in that style.

 Description 

This is a group exercise in building environments.  One player starts by
entering a `space` through a `door`, and then leaves that space, through the
same or through another door.  Any doors placed remain where they are, and
the characteristics of the door are not to change.


Then another player enters the same space, and places a mimed object in that
space, either by physically placing the object (
carrying, wheeling 
 or pushing it into
the space, or by just `using` it, for example by hanging her coat over a chair.
Second players leaves the room, either through one of the established doors,
or by placing a new exit.

 This continues until every player has done their thing.  Each player
needs to respect, and perhaps use all objects placed by previous players.

 order by blue

 Notes 

Keep the silly criteria (order by blue) till the end.  Usually, the players will
start realizing that it doesn`t really matter what the order is, as long as the
group agrees on the order.  


Criteria like mental health or personal hygiene are quite interesting to 
train on  Chivalry .

				The game starts with one person improvising a solo scene.  At some point, as second player enters, and with the first player, starts a new scene. This continues, more players entere one at a time, each time transforming the scene into something new.

"This improv game is called Guest Game and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Narration
 Performance


 Description 

In this improv game we play a scene in which one player is a guest, somewhere.  We
do not know who he is, or why he is visiting, or what his relation might be
with the characters at the location.  All 
other characters in the scene behave strangely or suspiciously, as if they
have a secret.  The idea is that by the end of the scene we understand their
secret.

 For example, a player might ring a doorbell at a house, ready to pick up 
his date.  We never get to see the date, and all characters in the scene 
slowly provide hints as to what might have happened to the date.   The game is
over when e.g. we (the audience) discover that all occupants of the house 
have been hauling garbage bags out of the hous, all containing body parts of
the date...  It need not always be gruesome, though..."

 Description  
This is a fun warm-up game, and a good one to teach players to deal with failure.
  We are going to say Ha-Soh-Kah; all players in a circle.  The player that starts with Ha  holds her hand, horizontally, near her forehead.  The next player is the one her fingers are pointing to (left or right; first player can choose which hand to use and which direction to point to).  Next player says Soh, hand horizontally, near the chin, pointing again, either to the left or to the right.  The player the Soh points to does Kah, and points with both hands to the next player, who does a Ha again, and so forth.
 When someone makes a mistake, the whole group says rhythmically: You are out of this game.  Whoever is out steps 
out of the circle and tries to make the remaining players make a mistake."

 Description 


Get everyone into a circle, holding hands.  One player starts the game by
squeezing the hand of one of his neighbors.  The receive then squeezes the hand of his other neighbor, thus generating a `squeeze wave` through the circle.

 Variations 

 Squeezes can run in different directions, and you can have more than one
squeeze wave cycling through the circle at a time
 Instead of squeezing, you 
can make players communicate by pressing (or even slapping) hands together
 Squeezes can run at different rates - this can be controlled by letting
nobody squeeze their neighbors as long as the squeeze they receive is not over
yet
 You can have one player try to `detect` the squeeze (try and squeeze as
unnoticeably as possible)

"This improv game is called Harold and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Format
 Long Form
 Performance



 Description 
Harold is a long format, and consists of a number of sub-formats. 
It basically consists of 3 components:


Scenes, with 2 to 4 players 

Games 

Monologues 


The format starts with a suggestion from the audience - this could really be 
anything. Players will start associating around the suggestion, and then an 
opening game is played. In this game, a lot of associated elements round 
the audience suggestion are presented. The opening game might be a song, 
a monologue, or simply a group association based on the audience suggestion. 
The idea is to use the elements and themes that come up or about in the 
opening game in what follows.

Then follow 3 rounds of scenes, all based on the themes found in the opening 
game. Each round exists out of 3 scenes, all unrelated, but each loosely based 
on the themes and associations form the opening game. Since these themes 
originated for the same audience suggestion, 
the audience will (hopefully) 
feel some links between the scenes.

After the first round of 3 scenes, an improv game is played; this game 
is unrelated to the 3 scenes played before. Then, in the second round, each 
of the 3 previous scenes is continued, and more or less obvious links between 
the scenes start to emerge. This is again followed by an improv game, and then 
the 3 scenes are played into a conclusion.

It`s quite possible that in the third round not every scene is continued; 
scenes may disappear or even merge with one another.

A Harold can be played with a decent number of players (up to 12 or so), 
players can act in multiple scenes, as the same or as different characters. 
A Harold can be played with or without props, with or without directors.


Whether one sticks to the 3 rounds or not is really not relevant; anything and 
any combination of games and loose scenes that finally more or less come 
together can be considered a Harold.

is an American format, described in  Del Close `s

 Description 

Start a scene, and identify each of the characters by means of a hat.  The MC 
will interrupt (freeze) the game from time to time, and switch the players`
hats.  After the switch each player becomes the character that previously wore
his or her hat.

 The story needs to continue and should make sense.

 Notes

A very silly game.  2 improvisers put on hats, preferably similarly sized.  Scene ends when one player grabs the other player`s hat or tries to do so and misses.  Any grab, move to grab or defensive movement needs to be 
fustified.  Try and play the scene for reality.   

  Variations 

Start with a 20 second window in which no grabs are allowed, so that the 
scene and the relationships between the characters can evolve."

 Performance


 Description 

Excellent game to show how  Endowment works.  2 players; each player will
state the action the other player must perform, followed by his own line.


Example:

 1: I want a divorce
 2: She said, while grabbing a knife from the kitchen table. At this 
point player 1 needs to take a knife.  Player 2 continues with his own line. 
Sure Honey
 1: He said, while turning to the sports page of the paper.  Now, it`s 
quite clear that player 2 should be paying more attention to the paper than 
to his wife.  Player 1 continues with her own line. You`re not listening to
me
 and so on.


Players refer to each other as `he` and `she`, and endow each other with the
next action to take.  This can be quite funny, if you endow your partner to
do crazy or not-so-nice things to you (or to themselves, but 
that`s would not 
be  Mr. Nice Guy ).

 Variations 

Can be done with 4 players: 2 provide the lines, and the 2 others provide 
the `directions` - each director provides the action for one of the 2 talkers.



Can also be one with 3 players: one provides directions and both other players
do their own dialogs.

 Notes 

Keep the action do-able and active.  Making someone else `think about something`
is hard to play, and not very active.

"This improv game is called Imitate and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Characters
 Exercise


 Description 

This is an exercise for characters.  2 players will play a scene in a shop.
The quality of the scene is irrelevant here, really; just get into the shop,
order what you need, pay for it and off you go.  
Give us an object (a carrot) and we got a scene in a carrot shop.  One player is designated as shopkeeper, 
and the other will play the customer.

 The idea is to give the `customer` a basis to build a character.  She will
enter the shop in that character, and the other player (the shopkeeper) tries
to imitate the character as closely as possible.

 Use the following tricks as stepping stones for building characters:

 Ask `customer` to talk to you in different voices.  Pick one of these and 
there she goes.  
 Ask the `customer` to pull different kinds of faces.  Pick one and there 
she goes.
 Pick a body part (elbow).  There she goes; taking the suggestion `elbow` 
as inspiration 
for her character.
 Pick an emotion and there she goes.
 Ask her to move around a bit, dance and let her freeze.  The position in 
which she is frozen is her inspiration for the customer character.

 This is an exercise for both players, but what is exercised is different for both:

 for the customer, the exercise is building a character out of a silly suggestion.  Note that there are not good or bad characters; anything in the position/suggestion given to the player can be used as inspiration, even if the `link` between the suggestion and the actual character is not obvious.  The only goal is to come up with interesting, strong characters.
 for the shopkeeper this is a listening/watching exercise.  The idea is not for the shopkeeper to build a character based on the suggestion; it is for him
to imitate as closely the character treats of the customer.

 Format
 Performance


 Description 

This is like the little brother of  Impro Match , and like Impro Match it is popular in French-speaking countries, particularly in France, Belgium and Switzerland.  Here is how it works.

 2-4 teams of 2 players play a competition.  They play rounds of improvised scenes, the titles (or themes) are provided by a referee .  Themes may include limitations like no speaking, or a style (western). Teams get 5 seconds to prepare before the scene starts.  Preparation time is called caucus. The audience votes which team wins the point.

 The catch aspect refers to the extravant dressing up of the teams, like westlers in a catch match.  Be it that the teams not neccesarily dress up like catch players; any type of dress-up goes.

 Origin 

The format is attributed to the Belgian company Tadam and    Inedit Theatre in Strassbourg.   As far as we know, and unlike  Impro Match the format is not copyrighted in the sense that a license is not needed to perform it."
"This improv game is called Impro Match and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Format


 Description 


This format does not have a specific name  and is mainly popular in French 
speaking countries. There seem to be leagues in just about every French 
speaking country; there`s even a league playing this format in the Congo! 
These leagues meet every year to play a world championship. 

The format is modeled after an ice hockey match: 2 teams of 6 players, 3 men and 3 women, perhaps with one coach per team play each other during 3 
30-minute rounds, in a `ring` resembling an ice hockey field. The game is 
lead by a referee and 2 aides. 

The referee draws challenges out of a bin; challenges can be mixed or separated.
 A mixed improv scene is played by players of both teams; a separated scene is 
played twice, each time by players from one team. Challenges consist of:


Title for the scene: can be anything 

Number of players per team: can be unlimited, or specified. In some countries
 they may even specify the genders, like 
`2 females for the red team, 
unlimited for the blue team` 

Category: might be anything, but examples would be Science Fiction, Drama, 
Dostojewski, Western, Musical, Opera, Without words or Without sound, 
or To Be Continued. For the latter one, the scene played by the first team 
is to be continued by the second team 

Duration: a number of minutes, ranging from 20 minutes to 30 seconds 


During the improvisation the referee walks though the scenes, and blows `faults` on a whistle. Possible faults would be: Dragging (slow play), 
Invalid number of players, Violation of the theme (or title), Confusion, 
Obstruction or Foul Play, Blocking, etc. Every fault is indicated by a 
particular gesture. When entering the theatre, the audience receives a 
`fault card` explaining which gesture indicates which fault. Fault can be 
awarded to an entire team, or to individual players. When a team collects 
3 faults, the other team receives an extra point. 
r
When a player collects 3 personal faults, he or she is expelled from the 
game for 5 or 10 minutes.

Every member of the audience also receives a slipper. 
 This can be thrown into the ring when the audience doesn`t like a scene, 
or even better, at the referee, whenever he or she makes an unpopular 
decision.

After each round the team captains may ask the referee for an explanation 
on the faults that were blown, and then the audience gets to vote. Every 
team has a color, and the audience gets colored cards to vote with.


After 3 30-minute rounds we know which team won the match. Finally, a 
celebrity or local hero gets to award `stars` to the 3 best players.

This is a very rigid format, in which just about anything, except the 
scenes themselves, are fixed. There is a whole protocol to be followed to 
play a match, and even the number of separated and mixed scenes is set in 
stone. The idea is that the rigidity of the format 
contrast well with the

"This improv game is called Interpretation for the Deaf and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Experts
 Performance


 Description 

We need 3 players for this game.  One will be an expert on a topic provided by 

the audience; another will be the interviewer.  The third will provide 
simultaneous interpretation for the deaf, using `sign language`.

 Notes 

This works best if the interview 
itself does not go too fast, so the interpreter
has plenty of time to translate.  Also helpful are returning keywords that the
translator can always translate the same way.



A gimmick is to translate everything literally, even `dummy` words, like `oh`,
`great`, `hm hm`.

 We originally listed this game under the title Translation for the Deaf - the American sign language institute pointed out to us that the correct term is indeed interpretation."
"This improv game is called Introducing Association and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Association
 Exercise


 Description 
This little technique can be used to show a new group how natural associating
really is.  You can only do this with a new group, that has not played any
association games before.



Place all players in a circle.  Ask one player to say a word, no matter which
one.  The player to her right then says no matter what word, and so on.  Do
not tell them they should try and `associate`.

 You (and hopefully the group) will notice that patterns of `related` 
or `associated` words emerge.  Use this as an introduction to show how 
natural associating is to humans, 
and then proceed with the other association
games."

 Warm-up


 Description 

This is at times a physical  Warm-up , a physical association game, and
a game for character work.  The game is played individually but all players 
can do this simultaneously.

 All players mill about the room.  At any point the trainer yells Yes!,
at which point all players `jump` into a position.  Trainer can (but does not 
have to) sidecoach by
shouting `direction` (see  Fast Food Laban ) like `horizontal`, `up`, `down`, 
`sideways`, `big`, `small`, `light`, `heavy`.  

 The idea then is to let the position into one has jumped inspire the player
to a character, a situation.  The inspiration comes from associating the position with, erm, well, whatever comes to mind.

Nice warm-up, easier to play than to explain.  Players in pairs.  Establish a beat (by slapping your thighs).  Once beat is established
every player has the choice between 4 different movements:

 Move both hands up
 Point both hands left
 Point both hands right
 Point both hands down


So, every beat goes like, slap, point, slap, point and 
so one. Except, when the 2 players happen to make the
same movement (i.e. in the same direction) then after the next slap they both make a 5th movement: point both 
hands towards the other player, miming a gun, and say `psssst`.  Next beat they do what they want again."

 Description 
 Improvise a simple scene.  Then the scene is replayed, from the point of view of one of the characters.  You can replay several times, from several POVs.

 Make sure the scene is such that the relationships between the characters 
allow for clear POVs.  A scene about dryly buying a pair of 
shoes does not
lead to exciting POVs... Also known as Rashomon. - after the movie by Akira Kurosawa, 
that follows different points of view as well.  For the same reason: Also known as Kurosawa.

 The technique can be used as an excellent  Narration  Exercise : have one improviser tell a story, something simple like what happened to him or her today, interacting with other characters.

"This improv game is called La Ronde and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 


This is another  Long Form improv format.  The name is based on a novel by Arthur Schnitzler, called Traumnovelle, in which a series of characters sequentially
bed each other, from first to last back to first.

 The format is fairly simple: we play scenes in which at every scene switch,
the `oldest` character disappears and a new scene is played with the remaining
character, and a new one.  The form ends when the circle closes and the last
and first characters do a scene.  Obviously, there is no need for all characters
to bed each other!

 Switching scenes is done by tagging out (like in  Freeze Tag ).  The
idea 
is to see different aspects of a character, in different situations,
interacting with different characters.

 Description 

This improv game is called Location, Career, Death (LCD).

 One player on stage, the others off stage.  The audience provides a location, 
an occupation and an object, only known to the player on stage.  Second player enters and a scene is played in gibberish.  Player one needs to communicate the location 
to player 2; as soon as player 2 thinks he`s got it, her claps his hands and spins 
around.  Then player 2 needs to guess the occupation; clap and spin when you think
you got it.  Finally, the object needs to be revealed.  As soon as player 2 has the
object, he needs to kill player 1 with it.

 Then the next player comes on stage and the game recommences, until all players
have played.  Afterwards, line up the players and ask them where they think they
were, what their occupation was and what the murder weapon was - usually quite far
off the original suggestion, much

"This improv game is called Lets Not and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories:

 Description 

Excellent game to train narrative skills, but a bit controversial.



Play in pairs: start with a location (e.g. a beach).   One player give the suggestions (e.g. 
let`s find a talking crab).  The other player either accepts the offer, and both play accordingly, or refuses the offer.  When an offer is refused the first 
player needs to make a better offer.

 Notes 

This is a bit controversial in the sense that players may object to refusing
offers; after all, we teach players to accept offers.  
Explain that the goal
of this exercise is twofold:

 teach players to drop their own ideas (see  Chivalry ) and happily change course in their story
 teach players which offers are `fun` and which ones are not.  The player 
accepting or refusing the offers should accept any offer that `feels good` or 
that advances the story, and only reject offers that don`t sound like fun or don`t seem to offer any potential for an interesting story.

 Warm-up


 Description 

Warm-up game that`s also good to get to know each other`s names. 


Everyone in a big circle. You start by `giving` your neighbor your name.  Just
lift your right arm and call your name to your neighbor.  He does the same 
to his neighbor, and names run around the circle.


Then do the same with the letters of the alphabet.  Give an `a` to 
your neighbor, making a 
`giving` gesture with your right hand.  Your 
neighbor continues by passing a `b` to his neighbor, and so on.


Ditto with the numbers 1 to 9.  Use another gesture, e.g. pass the number 
by tipping your right foot in the direction of your neighbor.


When everyone`s got this, try all of this at the same time.  Start by passing 
your name, and as soon as the name thing has advanced 2 or 3 players across
the circle, set a letter thing in motion, and then a number thing.  If you
have enough players, just mix and match.

 Notes 

Pay attention to how much gets lost - does everything you set in motion
eventually get back to you or not?  You can coach players by saying they
only need to pay attention to what their neighbor does, not what`s going on
elsewhere in the circle.

 Variations 

Feel free to pass other things, each with it`s own gesture.  Possibilities
are:

 months of the year;
 notes (like `do`, `re, `mi`, ....)"

 Description 

Simple exercise, useful for players that are too verbal.

 One player starts a scene.  As soon as the trainer claps his hands, the player needs to make whatever he was doing more interesting, without
advancing.  If our player was opening a briefcase at the clap, he needs to make `opening a briefcase` more interesting; he is not allowed to 
take something out of the briefcase, as that would be advancing; player needs to stick to `opening the briefcase`.

 Notes 

Simple to explain but not so easy to play. When done well you move into the clownesque.  Think about Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy or Mr. Bean.

 Variations 

At a second clap, allow the player to advance the scene.  Also known as Advancing and Expanding."

mantra in their head, and replay the scene `I`m so 
happy, I`m so happy`.  In 
many cases, you will find that the whole scene becomes happier.

 Variations 

 
Try with other mantras, like `I hate you`, and see what the effect is.
 Let players choose a mantra, and then play a scene.

 Description 

Here`s a way to make a point about blanking one`s mind, subconscious thinking
and spontaneity.  

 Have all players sit down comfortably, if they want to close their 
eyes they can do so.  Then ask them to blank their mind, to try and think
about nothing at all.  Let them do this for 2 minutes or so.  While they do so,
make sure to walk around, to make some minor noise (blow your nose, clear your 
throat, walk around) - but don`t overdo this.  If you can hear cars drive by
in the street, or other people in the 
building, or hear birds sing then you 
don`t even have to make a noise.



Then ask the players who managed to think about absolutely nothing at all.
Ask those who say they did whether they heard the birds, the cards, you clearing
your throat.  If they did, weren`t they thinking about that, then?

 Now ask the players to close their eyes, and to keep repeating the sound 
`mihad` in their heads.  Have them do this for about 3 minutes.  Then ask 
them again who thought about nothing but `mihad`.  If they are honest they
should all admit they thought of all kinds of stuff.

 The point is that our minds just never stop working.  Even if you`re trying
to concentrate on a repeating sound in your head - a Mantra - your mind will
still wander.

 We are all capable of thinking about several things at a time, some people
can keep up to 7 lines of thought going in their minds.  Who has never driven
a car, being perfectly concentrated on the traffic, without thinking about
work, the 
groceries, the kids ?

 You can use this exercise to show students they never need to be afraid
of a brain freeze - our brains manage to come up with so many things all
the time - if
you let them.

 Mantras are used as a technique for (Transcendental and other) meditation. 
The idea is to keep the most active part of your consciousness busy, and at
the same time let unconscious processes and lines of thought surface.  This
is similar to what happens in our dreams, but it has been proven (we`ve been
told) that these meditation techniques can be more relaxing or cleansing than
sleep.  Don`t take our word for that, though.

 Notes 

You can choose any gobbledygook word for a mantra for this exercise, as long
as it`s not an existing word (don`t use `banana`) or strongly resembles an
existing word (`banano` wouldn`t do either) - that could trigger people to 
think about monkeys, or a jungle, or whatever.

scenes."

"This improv game is called Master Servant Disaster and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Exercise

 Status


 Description 

2 players, one is the master, the other is the servant.  The master will ask the servant for something simple.  The servant always blocks the question, and 
explains why this should not be possible.  The master always accepts this, and 
asks for something else (which turns out to be impossible as well).  Every time
the servant has to explain why this should not be possible, the situation gets worse, until the whole thing turns out to be a disaster.

 An example:

 Perkins, get me a glass of brandy.
 Yes sir.  Oh, sir, that won`t be possible sir, we`re out of brandy.
 Well, get me a glas of whisky, then.
 Yes sir.  Ah, sir, um, we`re out of whisky too, sir.
 Oh?  Well get my any kind of alcohol, then.
 Ah sir, we`re out of alcohol sir.
 Perkins, have you been drinking again?
 Well, the 
staff had a little party last night, sir.
 I see.  Well get me a glass of water from the kitchen then.
 Yes sir.  Ah, sir, the water pipes are bust sir, sorry.
 Well, get me some water from the pond then.
 Ah, yes, sir, uh, sorry sir, the pond is dry, sir.



And so on, until it turns out that the staff had a little party, accidentily set
the kitchen on fire, used the water from the pond to fight the fire, and so on. Eventually, the only room still standing is the master`s study, the rest of the
castle has burnt down and all staff are dead.  And all this for a perfectly 
logical explanation.

 The idea is for the servant to connect all elements the master brings
up, into one and the same disaster.  In this respect this game resembles
 Boris ."

 Description 
Players in a circle.  Let them do a Mexican Wave: one player lifts both arms in the air, and down again.  When his arms are totally up, his right neighbour
starts doing the same, so a `wave` of hands circles around the circle.


When they`ve got this, at the same time, pass your name around the circle, 
going the other way.  Names are passed by pointing to your left neighbor and 
saying your name.

"This improv game is called Micetro and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Format


 Description 
Pronounce as `Maestro`. Comparable to  Gorilla Theatre , but a bit easier, 
and can be played with a fairly large number of players (
up to 20), and 
2 directors. 


The names of all players are on a big score board. The directors choose for 
every game the appropriate number of players, perhaps by fishing name tags 
out of a hat. The directors explain the improv game to be played, perhaps ask the audience for
 suggestions, direct and correct the scene. 


After each scene or game the audience decides, by cheering or applause how many 
points the scene should be awarded. Each player gets as many points as 
the scene he or she played in was awarded.



Once everyone has played in a scene, the players with the lowest score drop 
off, and the whole thing starts again. The directors ensure that (certainly
 with large groups of players) that there are more group-games at the
 start of the evening, and more 2-person scenes or even monologues toward 
the end of the evening.


This is a fun format that can be played with mixed bunches of experienced 
and not-so-
experienced players. Since players are immediately judged, it 
is perfectly possible to pitch a start player after the first round. 
Since this system is basically somewhat unfair, and everybody knows this,
 no one should take elimination too personal (well, that`s the idea anyway).

 For beginners it`s a nice format, as the directors will correct obvious
 blunders. And since all players in a scene get the same score, this format
 limits competition between players in a scene.


 Origin 

The (copyrighted) format is attributed to  Keith Johnstone , and also described in his book  Impro for Storytellers ."

 Description 

One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a 
couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor).  The 
idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through
the room, by talking.  



Also known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name 
`Airplane`: The blindfoldee (or just eyes
closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors.
He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic
Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a
chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane
also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) to
reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed
two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a
direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may
step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly
forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be
given from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling
directors. You can also destroy all the trust you`ve built up in your
class by completely clearing 
the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us,
someone will suggest it.

 Description 

This is not a   Long Form format, but a handle that can be used to end several types of Long Forms, especially ones that have different story lines, or are rather unstructured (see  Free-Form Improv ).

 It works as follows: when time is up players bring back bits and pieces of previously played scenes; the flow between recollection of one scene into recollection of another should be organic (see  Organic Edit ).  Take your time bringing back previous scenes, but speed up along the way.  A fun way to end the montage is like in one big boom where several recalled scenes occur in parallel (don't worry about the audience not being able to understand what's being said; if built up properly they will understand what's going on) and end simultaneously (perhaps hinted by a  Lights Edit )."

The players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience,  Based on
a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their 
own character in that story.

 The play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself.  The 
order in which characters speak is not really important, as long as they all speak.

 After the introductions, things start to happen.  Every character reflects on
what is happening from their own perspective, and each character adds elements to 
the story.

 Keep going (and make sure that every character keeps contributing) and 

 Reincorporating as long as things stay interesting.

 Description 

This is an improv game that`s more suited for rehearsal than for performance, though
I can work on stage as well.  Here is how it works.

Players call for new characters, by giving them names that refer to character
or physical traits.  Things like: Ah, here comes mr. Bad Irish Accent;  I think
we need Mrs. Pathological Liar for this one; Dear dear, if that isn`t Sir 
Eats-People.  And so on.

The idea is to challenge the other players with weird and 
unexpected suggestions,
and forcing them to come up with an extravagant character right away.  In a
sense this is really institutionalised  Pimping .  Another game in which
a similar pimping is used would be  Super Heroes ."
"This improv game is called Murder Mystery and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Characters
 Long Form


				This is a  Long Form format that can be played with a large number of players.  It is inspired by the Cluedo board game.

The basic idea is a gathering of many characters.  Audience may provide the reason for the gathering, and audience suggestions may be used to give each player a character. One character is destined to be killed; the other characters should have reasons to kill the victim; again audience suggestions may be used for that, or you let the motives evolve as the performance develops.  One player is set aside to play the detective; alternatively a second player may become the detective's sidekick.  Alternatively, the script for the gathering and a description of the characters are 
prepared before the show.

 The format starts with the gathering, at one point lights go out and when they come up again, the victim is dead.  

 Next, the detective(s) interview each of the characters (separately, though other characters may interfere during the questioning).  Each character  should make themselves suspect, at the same time of course denying every involvement in the murder.  The characters may try and implicate other characters.  Events discovered during the interviews may be played as flashbacks.

 After every character has been interviewed, the detective calls all characters together, Hercule Poirot style, and discusses the motives for each character.  The last character discussed is tagged as the killer.

 Then lights go out, and the opening scene is re-played, lights go out, come up again, and we finally see the murder happening, by the designated killer, in slow motion."

 Description 

You need 2 plastic bottles, each with a little bit of water (not too much or they`d
be too heavy).  Make sure your bottles are sturdy. or everyone will get wet.

Have everyone walk around leisurely, and hand 2 players the bottles.  The idea is to make 
eye contact with someone.  As soon as a player has eye contact with a player with a 
bottle, the bottle is thrown.  If at any point the bottle is dropped, both the thrower
and the receiver lie down on the floor and shout 'My Fault' as loud as possible.  After that, one of them picks up the bottle and the game continues.

Side coaching: tell the players to take risks, to try and make eye contact with a player 
at the other side of the room.  Explain that everybody 'involved' in missing the bottle can take the blame.  It's great fun and great energy when after a missed bottle everyone hits the floor, happily shouting 'my fault'.

 Variations 

 Tell the players the bottle is red hot, and they need to throw it as fast as possible,

sitting or standing in a circle. You give one person the ball, 
and ask him to name at least 6 (or any other number, depending on the size of
the circle), in the time it takes for the ball to get passed along the circle. 

Things to ask for might be

 sour tasting fruit
 foreign makes of cars
 names of seas

 Italian foods

 Variations 

Have one person in the middle of the circle.  This person provides the category,
and indicates how many replies are expected from a player in the circle.  If
that player does not live up to the challenge, he takes the place in the middle
of the circle.

 Notes 

 Tell players not to watch the ball go round when they`re `it` - they`ll just panic and freeze. Try this with closed eyes.

monster`s stomach or in heaven/hell), make friends with it, tame it,
 capture it, ride
it, whatever.

The real goal of the exercise is to get used to explicitly naming the problem
(the `monster` in this case).

(B).  At that point, A starts walking towards B.  Before A gets to B, B needs
to call another name (C), so B frees her spot in the circle, for A to take.  C
then needs to call yet another name and start walking, so B can take C`s spot.

 Variations 

Instead of calling names, players can pick another player by making eye contact (and nodding to acknowledge that eye contact has been made).  This demands
a lot of concentration.



You can have more than one cycle going, if the group is big enough.

 Description 

You can do this only once with a new group.

Tell them they are all chickens in a henhouse, and a nuclear bomb is about to
drop on the henhouse within 30 seconds,  Ask the players to play the chickens 
as truthfully as possible, then give them the start signal.

Any 
chicken that shows acknowledgement of the incoming bomb, fails the exercise.  Chickens have no clue what a bomb is.

The goal of the exercise is to show the difference between the reality of the
player and the reality of the character.

 Origin

 Description 

Good exercise on object work: players in pairs.  First player builds an object,
as precise and careful as possible, then hands it over to the other.  Second
player accepts the object, being as truthfull to what the first player built
as possible.  After having acknowledged this, player 2 starts morphing the
object into something else.  This can be done by bending, breaking, twisting,
extending, shrinking,
 you name it.  When the new object is complete it gets
passed back to player 1, who accepts and then morphs it.

 Variations 

You can do this in a circle, passing and morphing objects around the circle."

 Performance


 Description 

Place one chair on stage. The group sits or stands to the sides so they can
see what is going on.  Someone chooses an object from the room and places it 
on the chair. (Or get an object from the audience in a show) 
That object is your suggestion. 
 One at a time, three members (or how ever many you decide) do a short 
monologue off  that object. One person starts and when they are done, 
they leave the object on the chair for the next person. Whoever is inspired
jumps up next adding their part of the story/situation from another character`s
 point of view. and the third person completes the cycle. 
 This exercise is extremely character based. The first character sets 
the story in motion 
and then the other two people find a way to be 
another interesting character that will accept and heighten the first 
initiation. The challenge is to not be totally predictable with the follow up 
character choices (avoid immediately choosing to be the spouse when you could 
be that person`s mailman...or manicurist instead). At the same time you still 
want to support the story line and justify what the previous characters have 
already established. The characters don`t have to know each other, but they 
must have connections (if only through the object).

 This exercise helps:

 listening (you must listen to the characters before you to know how you can fit into the story/situation and justify it.)
 character work 
  Truthfulness (try not to focus `just` on the object. It`s about 
the relationships and connections between the 3 different characters.)

 Description 

One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a

idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through
the room, by talking.  



Also known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name 
`Airplane`: The blindfoldee (or just eyes
closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors.
He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic
Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a
chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane
also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) to
reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed
two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a
direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may
step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly
forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be
given from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling
directors. You can also destroy all the trust you`ve built up in your
class by completely clearing

One player (or the MC) is going to interview all other players, but the group of other players are
really one character.  This character answers the questions, but all players provide the answer at the
same time, as if the character is speaking out of many mouths simultaneously.  The answers should make
sense (at least grammatically) and should be clear.  If one player starts answering a question by saying
`YYYY` no-one should try and turn that into a `No`.

 Notes 

 works best if everyone goes for the obvious and simple answers.
 don`t try to speak too fast, but take your time to let the answer organically grow.
 coach players to take the lead if the answers is sagging, and to happily give up the lead
as soon as they feel they got the lead.
 move players that stubbornly always take the lead to another position in the 
group (at the
back or at the ends).

 Description 

A scene is improvised, in which any sentence used by the players must be a question.
Players that use statements instead of questions are boo-ed out by the audience
(audience yells `Die`) and are replaced by other players.  New players need to
take over the character of the players they replace.

 Notes 

Although questions are quite often frowned upon in improv (see 
 Questions and  Wimping ), in this game the idea is to build a 
story.  That implies that any question should be giving information, and should
be (implicitly) advancing on the information already available.  Evidently,
the next player should implicitly accept any information that was given
in the previous 
question(s)."

 Description 

Let the players walk around the room leisurely.  Then ask them to stop, open 
their hands, and let something fall out of the sky, right into their hands.
Let them name the object in their hands, set it aside, move on and open their
hands again.

 Notes 

Some people find this a bit of a scary game, as if they are afraid they are 
not going to come up with anything.  Explain that there are no wrong 
answers.

 Some players will complain that everything that falls out of the sky
is a dead bird (or whatever).  Explain to them that this is fine too.  Most 
players, if reassured that they really can`t go wrong, move on to other stuff
after 10 dead birds or so.

 Variations 

You can tell players they can vary the way they extend their hands or hand.
They can hold hands in front of them, above their head or close to the ground.
See if different stuff shows up.


A slightly less difficult version of this game can be done by having players 
put their hands in their pockets and take something out.  Make sure they all
got pockets if you want to play this game.  This version is slightly 
easier, as anything in their pockets, like dust, or the way the fabric feels, 
can trigger and idea; when holding your hands out there is very little to
trigger an idea.

 Description 

A scene is played.  Whenever the MC ring a bell (or yells `Ding`),

 Notes 

Doing `something else` is quite often interpreted as doing/saying the 
opposite of what you did before.  One can be more creative, e.g. repeat
what was said in a different emotion.



If you use this as an exercise on  Spontaneity the trainer can `Ding`
quite often (very frustrating for the players, 
but they will come up with
stuff they never would have thought of before).  Disadvantage of this is that
the story/characters tend to get lost.  Use sparingly for performance.

4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them.  The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in
front.  Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left).  So now we have a

side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells Call, at which time all players step back to their
original positions in the square.  MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns 
accordingly.  The 2 players in front

 pass claps either high (bending down) or high (above your head)
 combine both of the above.
 Try clapping twice, three times or 4 times when you pass the clap.  Make

 Description 

This is a fun way to do an improvised song with an audience member. You need 2 singers.  Invite someone on stage and do a quick interview.  Ask for their name, name of their partner/kids/pets, their occupation, hobbies etc.

 Then, improvise a song for the audience member, based on the information in the interview.  The catch is that only the singer the audience member is looking at gets to sing; when the audience member looks at the other singer, she takes over immediately."
"This improv game is called Ping Pong and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories:

 Performance


 Description 

This is like  Word at a Time Expert , but with a bit more scene work.  2 players, speaking one word at
a time, alternating between the players.  The scene is starting by stating who they are, or where they are.
Example: We-are-on-a-sunny-beach.  The players then actually play that, and build a story, word at a time,
and actually playing the story at the same time.

 For example: We-see-a-dead-whale; the players 
should actually see the whale, and do something with it.
There is no need to `say` everything before doing it ( use our motto: Play it, don`t say it).

 Notes 

Players have an adventure together; the story needs to happen to both of them, they are not to play
against each other.



As many players tend to verbosity, use a director that `cuts` the scene and tells the players what to do. 
Example: Give the whale mouth-to-mouth.

 Variations 

Allow a third character to enter the scene, playing against the two others.  Now the lines are done word per
word, by 3 players, but we have 2 characters.  This gets extremely silly/messy - to create some order out 
of this chaos make sure the third player (i.e. the second character) has a different voice (different accent
or pitch).  Unlikely to produce interesting stories, but quite hilarious.

 Description 

Before the show, ask the audience to write simple sentences on slips of paper.
Anything goes.


The game is played by 2 players.  Ask for a location, or a profession, and have
every player draw 3 of these slips.  Players put these in their pockets without
reading them.

 Then a scene is played, in which at any point in time, players  replace 
what they might have said, by whatever is on the piece of paper they draw out of their pocket.  
Try to incorporate/justify whatever is your line into the scene.

 Notes 

Try to avoid thinks like `My granny always said` - you want your character to
say whatever is on the piece of paper - don`t try to put those words into 
someone else`s mouth.

 Improvise a simple scene.  Then the scene is replayed, from the point of view of one of the characters.  You can replay several times, from several POVs.

 Make sure the scene is such that the relationships between the characters 
allow for clear POVs.  A scene about dryly buying a pair of

lead to exciting POVs... Also known as Rashomon. - after the movie by Akira Kurosawa, 
that follows different points of view as well.  For the same reason: Also known as Kurosawa.

 The technique can be used as an excellent  Narration  Exercise : have one improviser tell a story, something simple like what happened to him or her today, interacting with other characters.  After that, other players talk about the interaction from the POV of one of the characters in the original."

The only way to fend 
off a `sword` is by blocking it with your right arm.  If another player`s 
sword touches your body on any other part than your right forearm, you die a
gruesome death (also in slow motion).

 Description 

Great warm-up exercise that helps you blank your mind.  Good for control freaks.


Players stand in pairs and give each other presents.  To give a present, you
just open your arms/hands to indicate you`re holding something.  Don`t try
to think about what you`re holding, but give it to your companion.

 
Upon receiving the present, you give it a name, the first thing that comes to
mind.  You say something like `Oh, thanks, a little dead bird`.  You promptly
ignore your present and return something else to your companion.


This game works best if it`s played fast, so players really don`t have the 
time to preconceive.  It`s also nice and positive, as everybody is always 
extremely happy with their presents, no matter what they are.

n
If players complain they always receive the same present (It`s always a book)
tell them this is quite ok - they should be happy to receive so many books.  See

journalists, whose questions should provide indications to who the 
mystery guest might be.

 Notes 

The `journalists` should really play journalist characters.  They can take
photographs, or have a fight about who gets to ask the next question.

 Variations 

Instead of a famous or historical person, choose an expert.  The game is over when the `expert` figures 
out what he or she is expert in."

 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 

This  Long Form handle is basically a series of scenes, connected by music.  The music can be provides by a live player or band, or by a DJ.  The show starts with a piece of (preferably well known) song as inspiration for the scene.  The music is *in* the scene, and is not just underscoring.  Say e.g. The Girl From Ipanema is being played.  This might inspire the players to start a scene in an elevator.  As long as they are in the elevator, the music plays (or as long as no player finds a reason for the music to stop, like e.g. an electricity outage).  

 To edit, and go to a new scene, a new song is needed.  It can be initiated by the musician/DJ, or by a player, who may e.g. turn on the radio.  As the (new) song plays, the scene fades away and a new scene starts, again inspired by the song.  And the music is really in the scene until a player finds a way to stop or mute it, or leave the location where the music is.

 Origin 

This format was developed by the French improv theatre La Carpe Haute from Strasbourg."

 Description

4 players, one leaves the room.  Pick a means of transportation, and an object.
The idea is that player number 4 needs to guess the means of transportation,

hijacker to achieve.



The players need to provide hints to the hijacker, but they cannot explicitly
tell the hijacker what to do, with what or why.

Also known as Rebel without a Clue.

 Notes 

Works best is players take risks.  If they to the `wrong` thing or use the
wrong object the audience 
will probably just laugh, and that should be enough to signal the player he`s
going the wrong way."
"This improv game is called Receiver Right Clap and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories:

 Description 

Nice concentration and warmup exercise.  All players in a circle. Players
can throw a `clap` to any other player by pushing their hands 
together in
front of their chest (like a praying gesture), and then pushing both hands
towards the receiving player, opening up their arms as they do so.  Sending
a `clap` makes a `Whoof` sound; receiving a clap makes a sucking sound.


The receiver receives the clap by making the inverse gesture, and uttering
a sucking sound.


Once a clap is received, the player to the right of the receiver sends a new
clap to any other player.  And so one.


Once everyone`s got it, switch to left-hand side player of the receiver to send
the next clap.

 Variations 

If all players are really concentrating, and this game goes particularly well,
try `skipping` a neighbor.  E.g. the second player to the left of the receiver
sends the next clap."

"This improv game is called Rendez-vous and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Characters
 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 

The  Backstory for this  Long Form handle is as follows:

 We have an Evil Character.  The audience gets to choose who plays this character.
 The Evil Character will instruct 3-5 other characters to be at a specific (abandonded) place at a specific time.  There is no reason provided.  Audience get to choose which players play the 'invited' characters (the guests).
 Audience also gets to choose the location.  Good example is e.g. an abandoned factory on an island.  Location that have many rooms are ideal.

 The performance consists of 2 parts.  First part is 3-5 scenes in which each character is introduced.  In the scene, the Evil Character invites the guest.  There should be good reasons why the guests accept the invitation, based on whatever information was provided in the scene prior to the arrival of the Evil Character.

 Second part is where all guests have the rendez-vous in the chosen location.  They do not know each other; there is probably confusion.  When all guests have arrived, the Evil Character explains that be the end of the night, all guests but one will die.

 The guests then try and figure out why they are there, and perhaps evade their deaths.

 Supporting actors may play other characters the live ot, or haunt the location.

 It should be important that the characters cannot (easily) leave the location.  ( Also known as Behind closed doors. ).

 Performance ends either when only one guest remains alive and is set free by the Evil Character, or when the guests find out why they are there and are 'forgiven' by the Evil Character.  Or, alternatively, they might kill/capture the Evil Character and escape.

 Notes 

The Evil Character may turn out not to be the puppet master.  Perhaps he is just the messenger for an Even More Evil Character who reveals himself in the second part."

When the music stops, everyone should find a chair to sit on.  The player that doesn`t find a chair needs to find some other way to get his/her feet off the ground.

Remove a chair and repeat.  In the end, all players will have to find a way to not to 
touch the ground, by climbing and clinging on to each other.  Make sure you got sturdy 
chairs; we`ve known chairs to collapse under the weight of 10 players ...

 Description 

4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them.  The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in
front.  Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left).  So now we have a 
different combination of players in front.  These 2 get an audience suggestion.  Turn again and ask for suggestion
again and do this once more.  Then have players take their original position.

  The game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the
side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells Call, at which time all players step back to their
original positions in the square.  MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns 
accordingly.  The 2 players in front
start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again.

 This is repeated.  When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously 
played scene.  They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later,
a century later). Also known as Revolver. Also known as Pan Left Pan Right. Also known as Turntable."

Fun game to warm up and to teach players some  Chivalry .  

Everyone in a circle.  There are 3 things a player can be:

 An alien: hold you index fingers up next to your head, as little antenna`s and say 
`Bleeb bleeb`, bending inwards into the circle;
 A cow: bend forward, hold your right 
hand on your tummy and go `Moooo`
 A tiger: push your right hand forward, imitating a claw and roar.

 On your sign, every player decides to become one of the three.  The idea is 
for everyone to become the same, which obviously won`t be the case, the first time.  We re-do this until everyone is in sync.

a lot of disruptive noise.  You may want to do a `radio play`, 
where all players just sit 
on the stage, and provide the words and (background) noises for the scene."
"This improv game is called Scene Painting and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Performance


 Description 

Technique for building/advancing scenes.  To be used sparingly.

 The idea is that any player can stop the scene by yelling freeze, step out of character, and 
describe something within the scene, without interrupting what is going on in the scene.  After
nthe comment, player unfreezes the scene and steps back into character.

 Example.  2 players in a scene where a backpacker is looking for a bed at a house where an
old lady lives.  Backpacker comments on the fact that the house is chock full of stuffed animals,
an little pictures of backpackers, thereby implying that the old lady kills and stuffs backpackers 
(idea stolen from a short story by Roald Dahl).

"This improv game is called Sculptors and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Exercise
 Group


 Description 

Works best with an even number of players.  Split the group in 2.  
One half forms a circle in the middle of the room,
facing outwards.  The other half positions themselves, each player in front
of one of the players in the middle circle.

 The middle players are clay, or stone, and the outsiders are sculptors.
Let each sculptor do something to his lump 
of clay, then make the sculptors 
rotate clockwise.  Everyone now stands in front of someone else`s block of
stone or lump of clay.  Have them work some more on the sculpture and rotate
again.  Repeat till every player is in front of his original piece of stone
again.


Then ask the sculptors to introduce their work, and give it a name.



 Variations 

Each statue or sculpture has a built in voice chip that can utter exactly 
one sentence.  Let the sculptors switch on the voice chip at the end of their
explanation.

 Notes 

Excellent exercise to try with a new group to see who is  Mr. Nice Guy .
Players that keep placing the sculptures in positions that are impossible to
maintain or physically painful can easily be spotted with this exercise.


Other thing to watch for is which players undo the work the previous artists
made.  The idea is to build art together, not to destroy previously done work
in order to push your own ideas.  Make this clear by asking the sculptors, 
when
they`re in front of their original work again, to what extent the works still
looks anything like what they started with."

 Description 

Excellent game to get to know each other`s names.  



Everybody`s a cowboy or cowgirl, you get them in a circle and ask them to test their
revolvers. Have them shoot up in air, not at each other (yet).  Then ask the group to
concentrate; when everybody`s quiet, call someone`s name.  That person needs to drop 
to the floor as fast as he can.  His neighbors take a shot a him; if he`s not down 
r
fast enough, he dies (making grueling sounds).  If he`s down before a gun is fired, the
neighbor who fired last dies.

 
Insist that for every shot there should
be at least one victim.  If`s there`s any confusion about who shot first, they should all
spontaneously die.




Repeat till only 2 players are alive.  Place those 2 back to back in the middle of the 
room, and give them a sign to start walking away from each other.  When they hear you 
drop a coin (or a key ring, or whatever) they turn around as fast as 
they can and shoot the other.  
Again, at least one victim, and if they`re not sure who shot first they should both 
gladly die.

 Variations 
A shot can only be fired after a player has made a 360 degree spin.

 Another variation is to have players walk around.  Whoever gets caught in cross fire is dead.

 Notes 

This is really a game about  Chivalry and not about winning.  Use this game early
in a 
workshop to spot the students that stubbornly refuse to be shot and correct them.
You could consider your moment of death you moment of glory - show off how willing you are to accept you own death,
and die with enthusiasm."

Perfect game to learn each

Everyone in a circle.  One person (A) starts by calling another person`s name 
(B).  At that point, A starts walking towards B.  Before A gets to B, B needs
to call another name (C), so B frees her spot in the circle, for A to take.  C
then needs to call yet another name and start walking, so B can take C`s spot.

 Variations 

Instead of calling names, players can pick another player by making eye contact (and nodding to acknowledge that eye contact has been made).  This demands
a lot of concentration.



You can have more than one cycle going, if the group is big enough.

The idea is to use (and abuse) the techniques used in soap series.  Typically
this involves several story lines running at the same time, each story
progressing in tiny steps.  Other elements that can be used or spoofed are:

 poor acting

 Description 

An excellent group improv game to train listening 
skills. Taken from tho old wedding adage, Something old, Something new, Something borrowed, Something blue. 

5 players, one player - the bride, leaves the room. The remaining 4 players each get one of the following from the audience:

 Something old
 Something new
 Something borrowed
 Something blue

 The idea is that player number 5, the Bride, needs to guess each of the 4 players items. Game ends when all 4 items have been guessed.

The players need to provide hints to the bride, but they cannot explicitly tell the bride what they are or what they have. Similar in essence to  The Party .

 Notes 

Works best if players help the bride by providing hints as to the other characters items. The players can chose to be the item or simply have the item and try and present it to the bride only dropping hints. One example; Something old = Abacus, Something new = IPhone (new at time of writing), Something borrowed = 
Chainsaw, Something blue = Blue Whale. Very important that  the 4 players (not the bride) pay attention to the other players items and are available to drop hints to help it along.

 The other 2 players enter the same way.  Once players 3 and 4 are in, as soon as Freeze is called, 2 and 3 take on their positions in 
which they were
frozen, and continue their scene.   And so on backwards.

the stage to the left hand side, his character, played by another player,
should enter from the right.

 The character should stay the same, even though it`s played by a different player.

 Notes

might decide to make a hole in the wall, but stepping through this hole would 
make the character appear at the other side of the `room` - hard to justify..."

 Description 

This is a improv format that consists of monologues.  The story is not played, but told.
The players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience,  Based on
a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their 
own character in that story.

 The play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself.  The 
order in which characters speak is not really important, as long as they all speak.

a single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their 
own character in that story.

 Description 

3 players, and an every day activity (brushing your teeth, washing your car).



In this game, the every day activity is performed as if it were done at the
olympics or at a world championship.  One 
player is the athlete, and the two
others are in a TV studio - one is the interviewer who interviews the athlete`s
trainer, as the athlete performs the task.


Usually, something goes wrong and the athlete fails miserably. Gimmicks may
include:


 Interviewing the athlete on the field after the win (or the disaster)
 Asking for a replay of a particularly dramatic moment
 Asking for a replay with a different camera (different angle)

 Description 


Get everyone into a circle, holding hands.  One player starts the game by
squeezing the hand of one of his neighbors.  The receive then squeezes the hand of his other neighbor, thus generating a `squeeze wave` through the circle.

 Variations 

 Squeezes can run in different directions, and you can have more than one
squeeze wave cycling through the circle at a time
 Instead of squeezing, you 
can make players communicate by pressing (or even slapping) hands together
 Squeezes can run at different rates - this can be controlled by letting
nobody squeeze their neighbors as long as the squeeze they receive is not over
yet
 You can have one player try to `detect` the squeeze (try and squeeze as
unnoticeably as possible)


Also known as Hands."

 Exercise

 Description 


This is an idea/tool about the spine of any story. The whole point of the tool is to provide a model for a well-constructed story with a beginning that establishes a routine, an event that breaks the routine, a middle that shows the consequences of having broken the routine, a climax that sets the resolution to the story in motion, and the resolution. It goes like:


 Once upon a time...

 Every day...

 But, one day...

 Because of that...

 Because of that...

 Because of that...

n Until, finally...

 And, ever since then...


 And, here's how the lines correlate to the different sections of a  well-constructed story:
 
 The Beginning that establishes the routine:  Once upon a time...  Every day...
 
 The Event that breaks the routine: But, one day...
 
 The Middle that shows the consequences of having broken the routine: Because of that... 
Because of that... 
Because of that... 
 The Climax that sets the resolution to the story in motion:
Until, finally...
 
 The Resolution
And, ever since then...


 This little structure teaches performers to advance a story by changing 
things.  There are hundreds of variations known to this, one of which we`ll 
present here as well:

 The balance: Once upon a time ... 	and every day ...

 The un-balance: But then one day ... 

 The quest for a 
resolution: ... and because of that ... and so ... until finally ....

 The new balance: ... and ever since that day ....

In this improv game, players tell a story out of order, once sentence at a time. 

 One player steps forward and makes up the first line of the story.  This player takes place to the utmost left of the scene. A second player steps forward and makes up a last line that has absolutely nothing to do with the first. Take utmost right of the scene.

The rest of the players each fill in a line of the story wherever they can, trying to bring things together and end up with a story that makes complete sense. Every time a new line is added, the players go down the string and repeat their lines first to last. This game works best with 7 or 8 players. 

 Players ideally fill up spots in the 'line' randomly, i.e. they contribute new sentences at random points in the story.

 As a suggestion you can either ask for a title, a genre, or even first line and last line.  Or ask for no suggestion at all.

 If you have say over 6 players, it is ideal that the 3rd line that is added it tack in the middle, and very unrelated to both first and last line.   Resist the temptation to fill the spots linearly (from left to right).

 Description 

A great  Pimping game.  4 players.  First player gets from the audience
a silly little problem, like My Shoelaces are Untied, and a simple object, say
a kitchen cabinet.

First player starts a scene in which the Problem arises, and his character
is unable to fix the problem.  Hence she calls in (explictly) the help of e.g.
Kitchen Cabinet Woman.  This is a Super Hero, like Superman, Wonder Woman, you
know that kind of cartoon-character heroe types.  

Our 
Super Hero comes in with
lots of brou-haha (high  Status ) only to make the problem worse (and a status 
switch to low status).  So our hero calls in the help of yet another Super Hero.
Use whatever you can think of first.  Say Toothpaste Man.  Again this hero
comes in high status, screws up even more, does a status switch and calls in
yet another hero, who finally fixes the problem.

The game is really pimping folks into playing outrageous superheroes.  The 
status switch from high to low after screwing up is pretty important too here.

 Description 

nThis one is an extension of  Sculptors .  Divide the class in 2 groups, 
same number of players in every group.  
One group is clay, and they close their eyes.  The other group are sculptors.


The sculptors build one sculpture out of all the `clay` players.  The sculpture is finished when all of the players touch someone else (so all are connected to the sculpture).  The artists cannot `push` the clay into position - they need to `pull` parts of the clay into position without actually pulling.  `Pulling` is
done by touching a body part with an open hand, and then moving the hand about.  They `clay` players need to `follow` the moving open hands.


As soon as the sculpture is finished, the sculptors moves away, and re-build the 
statue, themselves now becoming clay.  The (original) clay players keep their eyes closed.  As soon as the imitation 
sculpture is finished, the clay players, eyes still closed, try to find `themselves` 
in the imitation.  When everybody has found themselves 
the game is over, and 
the clay players assess to what extent they found `themselves` and to what extent the imitation is exact.

r
5-4-3-2-1 can be played with 4 to 12 players. In this format the audience provides 5 different themes, objects, emotions, locations or situations. Then, the game is played in 5 rounds.

In the first round 5 scenes are played, each based on one of the audience suggestions. These scenes are totally unrelated. After the first round the audience decides which of the 5 scenes seen should be discontinued.

In the second round, the 4 remaining scenes are continued, and links start to appear between these scenes. Again, after this, the audience decides which scene to dump.

This continues until after 4 rounds there are only 2 scenes left. In the fifth round these scenes come together in one final scene. 
This format can be played with or without props and/or director(s).

"This improv game is called The Bag and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Characters
 Exercise


 Description  

This is a group exercise for building  Characters .  One player on a chair, up to 5 other players sit in front of her.
The player on the chair starts by taking something out of a big mimed bag.  She holds the object in front of her and
names the object - anything that comes to mind is just fine (see  Warehouse ,
  Open Your Hand or  Presents ).



The other players start asking the middle player questions about the object, why she has it, what it might mean to her.
After a few questions, she is 
asked to take another object from the bag - again, this can be anything and need not be 
related to the first object that came up.  This prompts more questions, and more objects.  



Continue until we know the character that is sitting on the chair.

 Notes 

The idea of the exercise is to construct the character as a group.  Both objects, questions and answers to the questions
will provide cues to who the person on the chair might be.  Avoid very leading questions, although any element in the 
questions should probably be accepted.



As soon as the person on the chair has an idea of who she might be, what her state of mind might be, how old she might be,
what her  Status might be,
 she should start showing these qualities, until she really `becomes` the character.  Use voice and body language to 
express this."

 Performance


 Description 

Invent a silly dramatic  story, and explain it to the audience.  Classic example is the following: After 
fixing the roof, Roger
decided to clean the house, including the cage of Mary`s gerbil.  He put the animal in a frying pan, from which it escaped to the roof, where it got stuck in some fresh tar.  Roger put it back
in it`s cage, where it got smothered by the fresh woodchips.  Roger tried to use a solvent to 
clean the creature, but the solvent fumes cause the creature to die of a cardiac arrest.  At that
point Mary walks in.  


 This is when 
the scene starts: Roger needs to explain what happens, but as soon as the audience
starts laughing Roger is replaced by another player who gets a new shot.  The idea is to try and
play the scene without getting the audience to laugh.

 Notes 

Don`t stick to the gerbil story - you can invent any silly story for this game.

Have the MC choose who provide what advice, so everyone can have a stab at 
really bad advice.   If the `bad advice` is really bad, then the Ugly advice 
should be even worse.

 You can play this as a  Die game - if a bad advice is not followed by 
an even worse advice, replace the last 
player by another one."
"This improv game is called The Interrogation and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 

This is a  Long Form handle: at the start of the show, provide some  Backstory to the audience.  Some character has been murdered.  The audience gets to choose which player is the victim.

 The cops interview her best friend, suspecting him to be the killer.  The audience gets to pick the player who will play the best friend.

 Audience also provides the names for both characters, and indicates how long the 2 have been best friends.

 The performance itself is a game of ping-pong between interrogation of the friend by the cops, and flashbacks.

 Performance starts with the interrogation.  A question might be How long have you  been friends, and how did you meet?  The scene then jumps to the moment the characters met.

 When the scene is over, we switch back to the interview.  We may now be at a different moment in time - the idea is that we see bits and pieces of the interrogation, at various points in time.  The friend can indicate time as in of course I am happy to help or OMG how did she die? (indicating time right after the murder).  Or say this is the tenth time you bring me in, or I've been here for 3 days now.  Am I under arrest? - indicating a later time.   There is no need to go chronologically in the interviews.

 Every interview question leads to a scene, based on the information provided in the answer to he question.  The scenes need not proceed chronologically - feel free to jump around in time.

 Performance ends when the cops ask the question Did you do it?.  Before the friend can answer, lights go out.  We will never know; we never see the actual murder either.

 Notes 

 The goal is not to find out whether the friend did it or not; the goal is neither to incriminate (or not) the friend.  The actual murder is really irrelevant; it's just a handle.  The real goal is to see interesting scenes about the characters, through time.
 If possible, set up an interrogation space on scene, where the friend can sit in a brightly lit spot.  During the scenes the spot light is out.
 Both victim and friend need not be in every scene.  The friend can tell hearsay information about the victim, and then we might see a scene where the friend does not participate.  Supporting players can play a variety of other characters, and need not play the same character in every scene.  But victim and friend are always played by the same characters.
 The cops should feel free to put pressure on the friend (light torture is permitted).  Feel free to set up a good cop/bad cop routine.  All cop cliches can be used.

 Origin 
 Format is attributed to Jeron Dewulf."

 Description 

An excellent exercise for  Look and Listen .  One player initiates a scene. Take your time establishing  Platform . A second player joins the scene; this player may 'come in', or alternatively he may have started on scene with the initiator. After the initiator has spoken his first line, the joiner repeats exactly what the initiator said. Then we interrupt.

 Ask the joiner what was established prior to the first line, as well as what the first line established.  This slows down the scene so the joiner gets the time to fully grasp what his scene partner has given him. This goes both ways - what did the initiator get from the joiner (non-verbally)?

 Then re-run the start of the scene and let it develop."

accordingly.  The 2 players in front
start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again.

Everyone at one end of the room, form a long line.  The first player of the line steps into the room and starts miming an activity.  As soon as the activity is
clear, player 2 approaches player 1 and asks `What are you doing`.


The first player answers something that has nothing to do with what he`s 
actually doing.  E.g. if player 1 is cutting someone`s hair, when asked what he`s doing he might say I`m reading the newspaper.


First player moves away, and the second player starts miming the activity stated by the previous player.  A third player comes up to player 2, asks what he is doing, and so on.



Play until everyone has mimed something, and has answered the question.

 Description 

Choose one player and let her stand in front of the class.  Then ask the
whole class to think what she would be if she were a car, a flower, a building,
a era, a foreign country, a mineral, a beverage, your name it.

 Notes 

Tell the group there are no wrong answers.  You may want to ask players what
triggered their responses - the answers will probably vary widely.

 If you are doing a series of workshops, it may also be interesting to
play this game early on, before people know each other, and then again after a
couple of weeks, when everyone has gotten to know everyone a bit better.  See
if the answers are any different."

 Description 

All players in a circle.  One folds her hands, with the two index fingers pointing up. After a short song (where do the fingers go, where do the fingers go) she points to the next player (anywhere in the circle) and gives him a suggestion of a location. He plays a short scene with both fingers as main characters and then the song starts again.

 Description 

Everyone stands in a circle. The group sends a phrase around the circle in either direction. Going clockwise the phrase is Whisky Mixer, going counterclockwise the phrase is Mister Whisker. When it's her turn, any player can reverse the direction the phrase travels by saying Misty Vista. 

 It doesn't matter if the players screw up the words; what matters is keeping a straight face. If a player cracks a smile or laughs at any time (irrespective of whether it was her turn or not), that player must run a lap around the circle

 Players can do anything  to try to make others laugh."

 Description 

One player leaves the room.  The audience provides:

 where we are, and when (what era)
 who the player will be (can be a person, or just his occupation)
 a physical handicap for the player (perhaps he`s blind ?)
 a problem the player has


Then a scene is played, in which the other players need to coach player 1 into guessing each of the 
items above, without giving any explicit clues.

Example: scene is played on the Red Square in Moscow, in 2050, where a limping salesman of vacuum cleaners
never sells any vacuum cleaners, since his prices are quoted in rubels instead of Euros (Russia is obviously
part of the Eurodollar zone in 2050).

 Description 

Everybody in a circle.  Start with one person, who waves both 
hands to his/her neighbor, saying `Whoosh`.  The next person 
passes the Whoosh to his neighbor, and that way the Whoosh is 
passed around the circle.

n

There`s 4 other sounds/movements that can be made.



`Wow`: indicated by saying Wow, and moving both arms down.  A
 Wow changes the direction of the Whoosh

`Zap`: instead of passing the Whoosh to your neighbor, it gets
zapped to the person you point to.  The receiver continues 
with either a Whoosh to his neighbor, or another Zap to 
another person.  A Wow after a Zap returns to the Zapper.

`Groooooooovelicious`: for this one the whole group bends down and 
up again in a kinda groovy way, all saying Groooooooovelicious.
Afterwards, the person who started the Groovelicious sets the Whoosh
in motion again, in any direction.

`Freakout`: indicated by waving both hands in the air.  Everybody starts 
screaming and moves to the center of the circle.  When everybody`s freaked 
out a new circle is formed, and the starter of the Freakout sets the Whoosh 
in motion again (or Zaps, or does a Grooooooovelicious).


 Variations 
You can invent other 
sounds and gestures.  You might replace Whoosh by a kind
of Vroom-Vroom, as is you`re in a car, and replace Wow by the sounds of brakes 
(`iiiii`) etc.

Also known as Zip Zap Zoop."

"This improv game is called Word at a Time Scene and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Limitations
 Performance


 Description 

This is like  Word at a Time Expert , but with a bit more scene work.  2 players, speaking one word at
a time, alternating between the players.  The scene is starting by stating who they are, or where they are.
Example: We-are-on-a-sunny-beach.  The players then actually play that, and build a story, word at a time,
and actually playing the story at the same time.

 For example: We-see-a-dead-whale; the players 
should actually see the whale, and do something with it.
There is no need to `say` everything before doing it ( use our motto: Play it, don`t say it).

 Notes 

Players have an adventure together; the story needs to happen to both of them, they are not to play
against each other.



As many players tend to verbosity, use a director that `cuts` the scene and tells the players what to do. 
Example: Give the whale mouth-to-mouth.

 Variations 

Allow a third character to enter the scene, playing against the two others.  Now the lines are done word per
word, by 3 players, but we have 2 characters.  This gets extremely silly/messy - to create some order out 
of this chaos make sure the third player (i.e. the second character) has a different voice (different accent
or pitch).  Unlikely to produce interesting stories, but quite hilarious.

Also known as Ping Pong. ."

"This improv game is called Word at a Time Story and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories:

 Narration


 Description 

This is an exercise to train group narrative.  All players sit in a circle.  We are going to tell a story
one word at a time.  Each player provides one word of a sentence.  End of a sentence can be indicates by a player saying `period`, although that is not necessary.

 Notes 

This is more difficult than it sounds, especially with newbies.  If you`re working with novice players have
them try a familiar story. like Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs first.  Summarize the story before they get
started, to make sure they`re all on the same story.  Don`t be surprised if gagsters manage to smuggle
atomic bombs and crashing aircraft into the story.  Ask the group if they can see/understand the reasons
why their story sucks.

n You can also play this a challenge with newbies: divide the group into 2 circles, and have them compete
each other - see which group can finish the story first."

Excellent warm-up, and great introduction to  Accepting .



Pick a group activity, like throwing a party or organizing a picnic.  One player starts, saying Let`s ... filling in what 
she wants to do.  Then she starts actually doing what she said she wanted to do.  A second player jumps in, saying Let`s ...
 do something else, to advance the group activity.  Both players say Yes, let`s do that and start doing whatever suggested.
Third player jumps in, suggests what to do, and again all players loudly agree to do it, and actually do it.  Continue till
everyone has suggested something.

"This improv game is called Yes Lets - or Rather Not and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Accepting
 Group
 Narration


 Description 

This is a bit controversial, and you probably don`t want to do this with newbies.  



This one goes a bit like  Yes Lets : all players on stage, someone provides
a location, e.g. a beach.  One player suggests an action.  All players that 
like the action yell `Yes, Let`s do that` and start doing it.  Whoever does
not like the suggestion steps out sits down.  Game continues till only one
player is left.

 Notes 

This one is a bit controversial as players will object that (one of) the main
ideas in Improv is to accept, and in this game one can reject a suggestion.


The idea behind this exercise is that we want our players to be  Mr. Nice Guy - 
players should try to make their co-players happy.  The problem is to learn what
suggestions are `good`, which suggestions make our other players happy.  And that`s what we`re trying to learn with this exercise.



Attitude is important  for this one:

 players should not feel inhibited to step out (i.e. they should not feel
that they are not accepting
 players should not feel rejected when others step out.  Be happy about that - you 
are learning which suggestions make others happy!  (see  Chivalry )."

 Warm-up


 Description 

Everyone in a circle. Everyone raises their right hand. The 1st person points 
to someone in the circle with their hand up and says you. They do the 
same until everyone`s hand is down, and the last person has pointed back to 
the 1st person, thus completing the circle. Important: This is a pattern that 
never changes. Repeat the pattern until it feels comfortable. Then switch 
places in the circle. Repeat the pattern. Close your eyes, and repeat the 
pattern.

When everyone is comfortable with that, everyone raises their hand again. 
The same 1st person begins. Name something: a favorite tv show, food, whatever.
Don`t point to the same person that you did last time. Once you feel 
comfortable with this pattern, you begin both. Start with you and add the 
next level. (Ex: you, you, you, string beans, you,
 corn, pizza, you, etc.).

If you feel that this is becoming too easy, add a third pattern, switch places in the circle, close your eyes.

 Variations 
 More of a challenge, start two patterns, and then add the pattern of pointing 
to someone, and saying the name of the person to your right. 
Once that pattern is established, switch places in the circle.
 Even more complicated: make another pattern by pointing at players.  Once the pattern is established, players in turn take the next player's position in the circle; every time someone takes a player's position, that player walks to his next person and takes that position.  Repeat this while passing the other patterns."
"This improv game is called You`re Fired and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories:

 Description 

This is a scene with 2 players, in which the lines are scripted.  Here`s the script:

 (1) {Knocks on a door}
 (2) Come in.  You know why I called you?
 (1) {Indicates she does not know why}
n (2) {Hands 1 a (mimed) piece of paper}
 (1) I thought you wouldn`t take that into account?
 (2) You`re fired.
 (1) Fine.  I hated that stupid job anyway.


 Have the players play that scene.  They need to stick to the script, but can really do anything as long
as they don`t add any lines.   It probably won`t be all that interesting. 

 Then make them replay
the scene, but give them a side coaching (which the other player and the audience or the rest of the 
group don`t hear).  See if the scenes become any more interesting.

Things you might give a player could be

 You`re nervous, happy, sad, afraid of the other
 The other smells nice/stinks
 You`ve been eating beans/garlic
 You turn into a crow/monkey/cow
 You are in a wheelchair
 You try to make a pass at the other
 Your underwear doesn`t quite fit (too small)
 You are a bit deaf, you can`t find your glasses, you loose a contact, loose your dentures   
 You are a 
kleptomaniac

 Notes 

Players can do quite a lot without deviating from the script.  They can build/open doors, windows, 
cabinets, make all kinds of noises or faces.



Remind players they can switch status.  Perhaps they could try and make clear what`s on the note?  Is it
bad, or petty, or funny, or sad?

 Variations 

Feel free to come up with a different scene, with different lines.
