 Icebreakers
 Warm-up


 Description 

Great game for getting to know each other 
in a new group.  All players in a circle, holding all 10 fingers up in the air.  One person at a time, start asking personal questions that take yes-no answers; whoever cannot answer yes to a question, drops a finger.  Last person with a finger left wins.

 Good questions are things like I have a cat, I have never stolen anything and so on."
"This improv game is called 3 Lines and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories:

 Description 

A great exercise to train scene start-ups. 2 players initiate a scene; the scene is broken off after 3 lines.  The goal is to establish as much as possible as fast as possible.  We want to understand the  Platform, the  Characters , the  Environment and the points of view or drivers of the characters.

 Once 3 lines of dialog have been uttered, restart a different scene."
"This improv game is called 3 Series and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Concentration
 Exercise
 Look and Listen


 Description 

Everyone in a circle.  Pick a category (e.g. make of cars, girls names, 
kinds of food, kinds of plants, whatever).  First person states an example of the category, and points to someone else.  Keep pointing.  That someone else does the same, with a different item in the category, and so forth, until everyone 
points at one person.

 Then repeat the pattern.  Make eye contact when passing your item to the
next person.  Drop the pointing arms when everyone is comfortable and the series
is collectively memorized.

 Then do the same with a second category, and make sure the pointing pattern
is different.  Repeat till everyone is comfortable.

 Then do the same exercise, without pointing, and running the 2 categories 
at the same time.  Add a third, fourth category if you wish.  No pointing arms any more!

 The idea is not only to listen for the item right before yours in the series (so you know when it`s 
your turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you.  If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken.  See also  You.

 Variations 
 Add another pattern by taking the next person's place in the circle."

Fun warm-up.  One player offers something, e.g. I am a slice of cheese.  2nd player jumps in and adds 
something to the offer, e.g. I am a slice of bread.  3rd player jumps in and again adds to the setup, e.g.
I am a pickle.  First player leaves, taking one of the others with him.  Restart from the remaining 
player, who restarts by saying what/who she is."
"This improv game is called Accepting Circle and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Accepting
 Concentration
 Exercise
 Warm-up


 Description 

Get everyone in a big circle.  One player starts by making a little gesture, 
perhaps with a little sound.

His or her neighbor then tries and does exactly the same.  And so on.  
Although
we expect the gesture/sound not to change, it will.

 Notes 

Watch for  movements that suddenly change left/right arm or leg.  This is
not really supposed to happen, but it will.  Once happened, it should be 
accepted by the next player.


Also watch/listen for little moans or sighs that players might make before or after 
their turn - these should also be taken over by the next player."

 Description 

Great warm-up that also helps a new group to learn each other's names.

 Everyone in a circle.  First person says his name, making a gesture (an action) for every syllable.  Mary has 2 syllables, so she does something like Ma- (wave right hand) -ry (claps in hands).  Everyone repeats this.  Then the second person calls his name, again with a gesture per syllable.  Group repeats, and then repeats all previous names and syllables."

"This improv game is called Advancing and Expanding and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Exercise


 Description 

Simple exercise, useful for players that are too verbal.

 One player starts a scene.  As soon as the trainer claps his hands, the player needs to make whatever he was doing more interesting, without
advancing.  If our player was opening a briefcase at the clap, he needs to make `opening a briefcase` more interesting; he is not allowed to 
take something out of the briefcase, as that would be advancing; player needs to stick to `opening the briefcase`.

 Notes 

Simple to explain but not so easy to play. When done well you move into the clownesque.  Think about Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy or Mr. Bean.

 Variations 

At a second clap, allow the player to advance the scene.  Also known as Advancing and Expanding."

walking a large circle.  The second player starts following the first one, 
and tries to move like the first player.   After a few rounds, the first player
goes to the back of the line, and the third player starts following and 
imitating the second one.

"This improv game is called Airplane and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Exercise
 Group
 Trust


 Description 

One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a 
couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor).  The 
idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through
the room, by talking.  



Also known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name 
`Airplane`: The blindfoldee (or just eyes
closed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors.
He is an Airplane lost in the fog being talked down by the Air Traffic
Controller, who must remain in his/her Tower. Standing on a
chair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane
also only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) to
reach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed
two brushes-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a
direct hit or stepping on something directly causes a crash. They may
step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly
forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be
given from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling
directors. You can also destroy all the trust you`ve built up in your
class by completely clearing 
the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us,
someone will suggest it.


Also known as Obstacle Course. Also known as Mine Field. See also  Fingertips for a similar exercise."
"This improv game is called Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Concentration
 Energy
 Warm-up


 Description 

Excellent warm-up.  Everyone in a circle.  We are going to establish a rhythm,
by saying, all together `Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves`.  Keep repeating this.



One person starts making a gesture to this 
rhythm, say, tapping your head with 
you left hand.  When the sentence is repeated, the player next to her takes over
this gesture, while the first one starts a completely different new gesture.  Third time
the sentence is done, player three does the first gesture, player two does the 
second gesture and player one invents a new one again.  And so on.

 This is also a concentration game, though it`s not really difficult.  All 
one has to do is watch the previous player, and next time, take over her gesture.
When you`re watching what everyone else is doing you`re going to get lost though."
"This improv game is called Big Booty and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Concentration
 Warm-up


 Description 

Everyone in a circle.  One player is Big Booty.  The others, going clockwise,
are numbered: 1, 2, 3 and so on.  Now Big Booty establishes a 4-beat rhythm, saying 
Big Booty, Big Booty, Big Booty (followed by a rest) - repeat this until 
everyone got the rhythm.

The game then goes as follows: Big Booty passes the buck to someone else, 
saying Big Booty to 7 (say) (this takes 2 beats, one for saying `Big Booty` and 
one for saying `to 7`).  Number 7 then passes in 2 beats to, say number 2, 
saying `7 to 2`.  It then continues  until someone makes a mistake: if and when that
happens everyone says (in 2 beats) `Oh Shit`, after which we repeat Big Booty
 Big Booty Big Booty (
+ rest on 4th beat), twice.  After that, the player that
made the mistake becomes Big Booty, and everyone`s number changes.  New Big
 Booty starts the game again."

"This improv game is called Deconstruction and its description is as follows: This improv game is in the following improv game categories: 
 Long Form
 Performance


 Description 

This is a  Long Form format.  It starts with one rather long scene, 
which is followed by other, probably shorter, scenes that somehow connect to
the first scene.  Possible connections are:

 Characters return
 Characters of situations mentioned in the first scene appear in the 
subsequent scenes
 Subsequent scenes take place in the same environment as the first scene

 The reason why the first scene should be fairly long is that it should
provide enough information for other scenes to build on.  The name 
`Deconstruction` can be interpreted as Take a first scene, and then 
deconstruct it by using characters, locations, situations, played or referred
to, and play/re-use those in further scenes.

 Origin 

Deconstruction originated at ImprovOlympic in Chicago.

 For a long discussion about the format and its origin see 
 Chicago Improv ."
